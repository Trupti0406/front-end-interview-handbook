        For learners, GreatFrontEnd projects allows you to learn front end
        development through{' '}

        our platform is made up of reusable components which adhere to the same
        design system, making them inherently modular and compatible with one
        another. This means you can seamlessly combine components from various
        projects to construct unique and customized applications for your
        portfolio. These components cover a diverse range of applications,

        GreatFrontEnd Projects has a unique feature set which stands out in
        important ways:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Every project is modular and reusable:</strong>
          <br />
          Unlike other platforms where every challenge is one-off and has a
          different look and feel, all our challenges are constructed out of the
          same design system. This means that you'd never have to waste time
          building one-off challenges - every challenge that you build adds to
          your permanent repertoire of professionally designed, reusable
          components, which you can compose into your future projects. Moreover,
          our components cover a wide variety of the most important uses like
          marketing, e-commerce, and web apps. For portfolio builders, this is
          important as you can use these professionally designed components to
          build a unique app for your portfolio, instead of building the same
          thing as everyone else, which is a problem faced on other portfolio
          platforms.

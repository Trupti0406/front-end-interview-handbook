## General

### What is available on GreatFrontEnd?

**Questions**: There are over 200 questions across JavaScript coding questions, User Interface coding questions, System Design content and quiz questions. For coding questions, you can practice within the browser without any installation needed, simulating real interview conditions.

**Guides**: If you are new to front end interviews, we have written in-depth guides to help you tackle front end interviews and front end system design rounds, most of which are free.

**Study plans**: A list of most important questions to practice and study, along with progress tracking.

### What is unique about GreatFrontEnd?

Out of the resources in the market for front end interview preparation, our platform boasts the largest number of questions with solutions written by experienced Senior Front End Engineers previously from FAANG, who were also ex-interviewers.

### What's included in GreatFrontEnd Premium?

More than half of our practice questions and all the study plans are premium, which can be unlocked by purchasing a premium membership.

### What does "free updates" include?

With a premium membership, you will get access to every new question and any guide we add in future. As new technologies and trends emerge, we update our questions and potentially add new questions/formats to keep up with the trends and you will get access to all of them.

### What experience level is GreatFrontEnd targeted at?

All are welcome! There is something to learn from GreatFrontEnd for engineers of all seniority levels. Beginners and junior engineers will be able to solidify their fundamentals and discover new useful techniques. Mid-level engineers will benefit from more advanced concepts like component design, accessibility, performance, and internationalization. Senior engineers will benefit most from the system design questions which impart architectural concepts.

It's never too early to start. Many of our users are students who have leveraged our ongoing [student discount](/promotions) for the annual plan.

## Purchase

### What are the various options to purchase Premium?

- **Subscription**: You will be billed a fixed amount at the start of every period according to your selected plan. You can choose to cancel anytime.
- **Lifetime**: A one-time purchase, with no recurring subscription fees. You get access to all the content in GreatFrontEnd's interview platform forever, along with any future updates. This will be useful and relevant for all future job hunts.

### The lifetime plan seems expensive!

The lifetime plan costs the most but we can assure you it is worth the money if you can afford it. With a lifetime membership, your premium status does not expire and you retain access to all premium content on the interview platform including updates.

No other platforms offer a lifetime membership and you have to pay every time you are job hunting. Consider the number of times you need to job hunt in the span of your career. Your lifetime membership will be worth it because you can use it for all your future job hunts. If you divide the cost by the number of months you can use it for, the monthly cost is considered pretty low.

Moreover, we are constantly adding content and prices will increase as the amount of content increases. You can lock in access to all premium content by purchasing the lifetime plan today.

### Will the lifetime plan be available forever?

GreatFrontEnd is still in its early stages of development and the lifetime plan is a limited time offering while we are developing both the platform and the content. The lifetime plan will be removed in future so if you think that you can benefit from the platform in the long term, grab the lifetime plan while it's still available.

### Do you offer discounts?

We have seasonal discounts and all-year long student discounts which you can find on the [promotions](/promotions) page. Additionally, we offer a 100% cashback reward if you post an honest public review about the platform. Find more details about the [cashback program](/promotions).

### What's the refund policy?

We have a "fair use" refund policy within 14 days of starting your first subscription. "Fair use" means that if you have accessed a significant amount of premium content (more than 10 premium questions/solutions), we reserve the right to reject the request for a refund. To request a refund, send an email to contact@greatfrontend.com.

### Are subscriptions automatically renewed?

Yes, subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of its period. Monthly plans are renewed every month, quarterly plans renewed every 3 months, and so on. An email reminder will be sent days before the subscription is renewed to give you ample time to cancel if you do not intend to renew.

### When and how do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription anytime by visiting the Profile > Billing page. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current subscription term and will not be renewed after the current term expires.

### What happens when my subscription is cancelled?

When your subscription stops, you will not be able to access premium content on the platform.

### I am facing issues (e.g. payment declined) when checking out

This is a common issue faced by customers from India and Indonesia because some card providers block overseas transactions. If you are sure your payment details are valid, you might want to call your bank and check if they are the ones blocking the payment. Many of our users have resolved the issue by calling up their bank.

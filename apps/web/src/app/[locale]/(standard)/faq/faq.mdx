### Are subscriptions automatically renewed?

### When and how do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription anytime by visiting the Profile > Billing page. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current subscription term and will not be renewed after the current term expires.

### What happens when my subscription is cancelled?

When your subscription stops, you will not be able to access premium content on the platform.

### I am facing issues (e.g. payment declined) when checking out

This is a common issue faced by customers from India and Indonesia because some card providers block overseas transactions. If you are sure your payment details are valid, you might want to call your bank and check if they are the ones blocking the payment. Many of our users have resolved the issue by calling up their bank.

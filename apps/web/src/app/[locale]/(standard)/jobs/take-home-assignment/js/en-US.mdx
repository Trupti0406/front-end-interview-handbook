# User Interface Question Take Home Assignment

Congratulations on advancing in the hiring process! As the next stage of the interview process, we would like to evaluate your technical skills and ability to explain concepts. We believe that it is an important part of our hiring process especially at a company like GreatFrontEnd, as it provides us with a clear understanding of your approach to writing front end code and educational engineering content.

Do not spend more than **2 hours** on this take home assignment!

## Task

Imagine yourself as someone already working as a Senior Front End Contributor at GreatFrontEnd and are writing the question description, solution code and test cases for any of the Lodash functions:

- [`_.over`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#over)
- [`_.flow`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flow)
- [`_.isMatch`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isMatch)
- [`_.range`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#range)

_P.S. The harder the chosen task, the most impressive it is (if done well)._

## Submission deliverables

Your submission should consist of the following parts:

1. **Code**: Use either [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), or a public GitHub repo to host your code. These platforms allow running of tests as well. You should not spend more than 2â€“3 hours on this entire assignment (including writing the question and solution). Include the following:

   - Skeleton code
   - Solution code
   - Unit tests (preferably in Jest/Vitest)

1. **Solution writeup**: Draft a writeup similar to GreatFrontEnd's written solution explanations.

_Tip: Refer to [GreatFrontEnd's Lodash JavaScript questions](https://www.greatfrontend.com/focus-areas/lodash) and look at how existing solution code and writeups are written._

## Mode of submission

Please attach links to your code and writeups and reply to the email.

# User Interface Question Take Home Assignment

Congratulations on advancing in the hiring process! As the next stage of the interview process, we would like to evaluate your technical skills and ability to explain concepts. We believe that it is an important part of our hiring process especially at a company like GreatFrontEnd, as it provides us with a clear understanding of your approach to writing front end code and educational engineering content.

Do not spend more than **2 hours** on this take home assignment!

## Task

Imagine yourself as someone already working as a Senior Front End Contributor at GreatFrontEnd and are writing the solution code (in React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte) and writeup for any of the following questions from FrontendEval:

- [Shopping List](https://frontendeval.com/questions/shopping-list)
- [Two-factor Code Input](https://frontendeval.com/questions/code-input)
- [Image Carousel](https://frontendeval.com/questions/image-carousel)
- [Data Fetching and Visualization](https://frontendeval.com/questions/data-fetching)
- [Crypto Converter](https://frontendeval.com/questions/crypto-converter)
- [Snake Game](https://frontendeval.com/questions/snake)

_P.S. The harder the chosen task, the most impressive it is (if done well)._

## Submission deliverables

Your submission should consist of the following parts:

1. **Code**: Use either [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), or a public GitHub repo to host your code. You should not spend more than 2â€“3 hours on this entire assignment (including writing the question and solution).
2. **Preview**: The code should be easily accessible via a preview website. CodeSandbox and StackBlitz come with built-in project previews. Other free options are Vercel and Netlify should you prefer to host your code on GitHub.
3. **Solution writeup** (optional for engineering roles): Draft a writeup similar to GreatFrontEnd's written solution explanations. As a guideline, explain how to break down the problem into smaller problems, what they are and how to go about tackling them. Explain the choice of state, how to go about building the layout, and the more complex functions.

_Tip: Refer to GreatFrontEnd's UI questions and look at how existing solution code and writeups are written._

## Mode of submission

Please attach links to your code and writeups and reply to the email.

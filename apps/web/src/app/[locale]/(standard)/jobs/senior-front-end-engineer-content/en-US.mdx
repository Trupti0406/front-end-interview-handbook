## What you'll do

This is a paid, **fully remote, full-time role** open to international applicants.

### Responsibilities

As a Senior Front End Engineer focused on content, you will be expected to produce high quality content for:

- **User Interface questions**: code, solution writeups, and test cases in React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte (or all of the above).
- **JavaScript questions**: code, solution writeups, and test cases in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **Algorithm questions**: code, solution writeups, and test cases for algorithmic coding questions.
- **Technical articles**: articles explaining technical concepts, introducing new technologies, and more.

### Minimum requirements

- 5 years of working experience in the front end engineering domain, either writing front end code and/or authoring technical content (e.g. documentation, blog posts, etc.).
- Strong in front end fundamentals, as well as data structures and algorithms knowledge.
- Ability to break down a problem into smaller ones and explain technical concepts in simple terms.
- Simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have good intuition for lasting and scalable solutions.

### Preferred requirements

- Prior experience working in big tech companies popular with front end engineer job applicants
- Experience in hiring and/or interviewing front end engineers.

## Pay and benefits

The rate for this role will be narrowed down based on a number of factors, including the candidate's experience, qualifications, and actual location.

## Take home assignment

Interested applicants should complete the following take home assignment and submit the required deliverables as part of the application.

This task will allow us to evaluate your technical skills and ability to explain concepts. We believe that it is an important part of our hiring process as it provides us with a clear understanding of your approach to writing educational engineering content.

Do not spend more than **2 hours** on this take home assignment!

### Task

Imagine yourself as someone already working as a Senior Front End Contributor at GreatFrontEnd and are writing the solution code (in React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte) and writeup for any of the following questions from FrontendEval:

- [Shopping List](https://frontendeval.com/questions/shopping-list)
- [Two-factor Code Input](https://frontendeval.com/questions/code-input)
- [Image Carousel](https://frontendeval.com/questions/image-carousel)
- [Data Fetching and Visualization](https://frontendeval.com/questions/data-fetching)
- [Crypto Converter](https://frontendeval.com/questions/crypto-converter)
- [Snake Game](https://frontendeval.com/questions/snake)

_P.S. The harder the chosen task, the most impressive it is (if done well)._

### Submission deliverables

Your submission should consist of the following parts:

1. **Code**: Use either [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), or a public GitHub repo to host your code. You should not spend more than 2â€“3 hours on this entire assignment (including writing the question and solution).
2. **Preview**: The code should be easily accessible via a preview website. CodeSandbox and StackBlitz come with built-in project previews. Other free options are Vercel and Netlify should you prefer to host your code on GitHub.
3. **Solution writeup**: Draft a writeup similar to GreatFrontEnd's written solution explanations. As a guideline, explain the choice of state, how to go about building the layout, and explain the more complex functions.

_Tip: Refer to GreatFrontEnd's UI questions and look at how existing solution code and writeups are written._

**Please attach links to your code and writeups in the job application.**

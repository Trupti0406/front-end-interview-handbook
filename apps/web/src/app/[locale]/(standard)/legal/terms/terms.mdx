# Terms of Service

_Effective date: 2nd May 2023_

These Terms of Service (these "Terms") govern your access to and use of **GreatFrontEnd** (the "Website"), a product of Codeney Pte Ltd (the "Company"), including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the Website.

By accessing or using the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Website.

We may change or update these Terms from time to time. We will post any changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of changes to the Terms of Service). We encourage you to review the Terms regularly to stay informed about our collection, use, and sharing of your personal information.

## Membership

GreatFrontEnd Premium memberships will continue until terminated, with the exception of lifetime plans. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below).

## Billing and Cancellation

The membership fee for GreatFrontEnd Premium and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the Stripe Customer Portal. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service.

To continue using GreatFrontEnd Premium, you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page's "Billing" tab and manage your subscription in the Stripe customer portal. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

You can cancel your GreatFrontEnd Premium membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Website through the end of your billing period. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused GreatFrontEnd Premium content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page's "Billing" tab and cancel your subscription through the Stripe Customer Portal. If you cancel your Premium membership, you will lose access to Premium content at end of your current billing period.

We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

        This is probably the only service out there where you can get a
        personalized review of your portfolio (and entire career trajectory)
        from senior engineers at big tech. Moreover, we are operating
        specifically in the front end domain, which makes our advice all the
        more specific to what is needed to succeed in this field. This service
        also costs less than 10% of the monthly salary of an entry level front
        end engineer, whilst the recommendations you receive can help you for
        the rest of your career - not just the initial job hunt.

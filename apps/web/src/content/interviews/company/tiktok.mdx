Interviews with TikTok are highly team-dependent and not standardized. TikTok asks a good mix of front end coding, front end system design (that involves coding), trivia quiz questions, and algorithmic coding questions. According to the community, most of TikTok's front end interview questions can be found on GreatFrontEnd.

Lyft's Front End Engineer interview process is highly practical in nature â€“ their front end engineer interview questions are focused on front end domain knowledge. There is a good mix of implementing JavaScript functions and building user interfaces. Candidates are free to choose whatever tech stack they are comfortable with, such as React, to build those user interfaces.

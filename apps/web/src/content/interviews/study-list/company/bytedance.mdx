Interviews with ByteDance are team-dependent. ByteDance asks a good mix of front end coding, front end system design (that involves coding), trivia quiz questions, and algorithmic coding questions. Do also check out [TikTok guide and interview questions](/interviews/company/tiktok/questions-guides) since TikTok is part of ByteDance.

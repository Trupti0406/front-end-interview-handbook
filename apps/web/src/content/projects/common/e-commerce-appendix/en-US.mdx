## E-commerce Data Appendix

You will be using data from a fictional e-commerce platform, StyleNest. The following article explains the available data entities.

### Products

_Data: `products.json`_

There are approximately 20 products about hats, bags, footwear, eyewear, or clothing. Each product has a unique `product_id` and most of the product-related data will be associated with a `product_id`.

### Product categories

_Data: `categories.json`_

There are 3 product categories: Men (`men`), Women (`women`), Unisex (`unisex`).

### Product collections

_Data: `collections.json`_

There are 4 product collections in total:

- 3 curated collections: Cozy Comfort (`cozy`), Urban Oasis (`urban`), Fresh Fusion (`fresh`).

Each product belongs to at most 1 curated collection and can also be part of the "Latest Arrivals" collection.

### Product inventory

_Data: `inventory.json`_

Some products have multiple product variants ("SKU"s) distinguished by 1 or more attributes.

There are 2 available attributes: Color and Size.

- **Colors**: White, Black, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Purple, Brown, Beige, and Pink
- **Sizes**:
  - Shoes: Sizes 4 - 12, with intervals of 0.5.
  - Others: Sizes ranging from XS, S, M, L, XL.
  - Note that some products do not have sizes!

Stock is assigned at the variant level. A product variant might be out of stock, for e.g. the beige-colored Classic Canvas Tee.

Prices / Discounts are assigned at the product variant level, since it is very common for XL listings to be more expensive than smaller listings in a realistic setting. Currently, all prices and discounts are the same across all variants for a product.

- **List price**: Refers to original price before discounts.
- **Sale price**: Refers to price after discounts.
- **Discount**: Refers to platform-wide discount for the product variant. This discount can either be percentage based or cash-off based, not both. Not all listings have platform discounts.

Knowing how to use CSS transforms and transitions is crucial for front end developers because these properties enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of web pages without the overhead of JavaScript. Transforms allow developers to rotate, scale, move, and skew elements, creating dynamic, engaging experiences. Transitions smooth out changes in CSS properties, making interactions like hover effects feel more natural and professional. This knowledge is essential for creating modern, responsive designs that engage users and provide sophisticated feedback on user interactions.

In this challenge, you will build a versatile toast component as part of a design system. These components will be essential for displaying notifications across various projects and apps found within the platform.

### Component states, variants, and properties

- **Variants**: Implement and style the component to reflect different variants â€“ success, error, warning, info. For comparison purposes, the various toast components are shown directly on the page.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Showing toasts**: Functionally, the toast should appear from the top of the screen for a customizable duration via triggering in JavaScript.
- **Transitions**: The toast element should transition in and out from the top of the screen smoothly.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

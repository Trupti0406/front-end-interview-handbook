In this challenge, you will combine some of the components you have built in previous challenges into an about us page.

As this challenge is a combination of other sections or components, you should build them first to ensure all states and requirements are covered.

### Implementation Requirements

The requirements that each component has to fulfill remains the same â€“ you should refer to them in their individual briefs and ensure that their functionality remains intact after integration:

- [Navbar Component](/projects/challenges/navbar-component)
- [Hero Section (Simple)](/projects/challenges/hero-section-simple)
- [Statistics Section](/projects/challenges/statistics-section)
- [Team Section](/projects/challenges/team-section)
- [Contact Section](/projects/challenges/contact-section)
- [Footer Section (Simple)](/projects/challenges/footer-section-simple)

On the page level:

- **Page layout rules**: Apply standard page margin and padding rules as per the design specifications.
- **Copy and asset alignment**: While the component used remains the same as the list above, some of the assets, icons or copy might have changed. Check through each section.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser and device compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and for all stated device breakpoints.

In this challenge, you will develop a responsive statistics section that fetches data from an API and displays it.

This challenge will require coding a responsive multi-column layout that reorganizes content based on the device's screen size to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Implementation Requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The layout should reorganize responsively. The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
  - **Image size**: The image resizes to fill the available width on tablets and mobile viewports.
  - **Element adaptability**: Ensure that text elements and images resize appropriately without distortion or loss of quality.
- **Dynamic content**: Fetch the data from an API and display the response. This is so that the displayed data is always up-to-date.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

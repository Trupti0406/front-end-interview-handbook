## Statistics API

To test your statistics section, we have provided a HTTP endpoint that returns dynamic metrics so that your section can show the latest data in real-time:

```
GET https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/statistics-metrics
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `latest` | `boolean` | No | Returns latest metrics. Defaults to `false`. |

### Returns

An array of metrics types and values.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "metric": "downloads",
      "value": 25664890
    },
    {
      "metric": "paid_users",
      "value": 17219
    },
    {
      "metric": "library_images",
      "value": 190654321
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The values in the response are intentionally hardcoded to match the design for screenshot comparison purposes. To get the latest data, append the `latest` query parameter.

#### Latest data

`GET`: https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/statistics-metrics?latest=true

## Example

To test APIs, you're recommended to install the [Thunder Client for VS Code extension](https://www.thunderclient.com/), a lightweight REST client for testing APIs right within VS Code.

However since this is a `GET` API, you can simply visit the URL in the browser: https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/statistics-metrics

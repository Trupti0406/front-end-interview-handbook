In this challenge, you will develop a minimal yet effective responsive navigation bar that exemplifies principles of responsive design, transitioning fluidly between desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

The navigation should offer an **adaptive hamburger menu** on smaller devices to maximize space and maintain usability.

### User stories

- **As a desktop user**, I want to easily access all sections of the website with clear, clickable links, so that I can navigate the site without any confusion or delay.
- **As a tablet / mobile user**, I want the navigation bar to collapse into an adaptive hamburger menu to avoid clutter on my screen, with the option to expand it when I need to find more information.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Links & Icon-buttons**: Implement and style interactable components like links and icon buttons to reflect different states - default, hover, and focus.
  - **Buttons**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, focus, and disabled.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Adaptive hamburger menu**: Hamburger menu should be implemented for tablet and mobile views. The menu should be expanded once the hamburger icon is tapped on.
  - **Transition on responsive breakpoints**: The transition from full navigation bar on desktop to hamburger menu on tablet and mobile should be fluid and natural, occurring at the appropriate breakpoints for tablet and mobile.
- **Accessibility and interactivity**: Ensure all menu items are displayed with adequate spacing for touch targets to accommodate users navigating via touchscreens.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance across devices**: Ensure that the navigation bar and hamburger performs well on all devices, with quick load times and smooth transitions.
- **[Stretch goal] Comprehensive accessibility**: Build the navigation bar and hamburger menu with a focus on accessibility, making sure that it complies with WCAG guidelines and provides a fully accessible user experience.

In this challenge, you will develop a responsive hero section based on the provided designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. The hero section will contain an image as well as a few bullet points outlining the key features.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Button states**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, focus and disabled.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The layout should reorganize responsively. The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
  - **Image size**: The image resizes to fill the available width on tablets and mobile viewports.
  - **Element adaptability**: Ensure that text elements and images resize appropriately without distortion or loss of quality.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Code for fast load times with efficient CSS and JavaScript techniques.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

### Objective

The Modal Component is a critical element of our design system, providing a flexible and consistent way to display content overlay. The objective is to design a versatile and visually appealing modal that seamlessly integrates into our design system while accommodating various use cases.

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Content Container:**

   - Design a flexible container that adapts to different content sizes and types, ensuring a seamless fit for various modal scenarios.

2. **Overlay Dimming Effect:**

   - Implement a subtle overlay dimming effect to draw focus to the modal content while visually separating it from the background.

3. **Close Button:**

   - Include a clear and accessible close button for users to easily dismiss the modal.

4. **Customizable Header:**

   - Allow customization of the modal header, supporting the inclusion of titles, icons, or other relevant information.

5. **Responsive Design:**

   - Ensure the modal is responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

6. **Animation and Transition Effects:**

   - Integrate smooth animation and transition effects for modal opening and closing, enhancing the overall user experience.

7. **Accessibility Features:**

   - Implement accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes, to ensure the modal is navigable and usable for all users.

8. **Backdrop Click Interaction:**
   - Enable modal closure when users click outside the modal content, enhancing user interaction.

### Technological Considerations

- **CSS/SCSS Styles:**

  - Provide well-organized and easily maintainable CSS or SCSS styles for seamless integration into our codebase.

- **JavaScript Interaction:**

  - Implement JavaScript functionality for modal control, including opening, closing, and handling user interactions.

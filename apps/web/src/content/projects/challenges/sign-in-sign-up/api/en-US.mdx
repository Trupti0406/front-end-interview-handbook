## Auth APIs (Sign in / sign up)

To test your sign in / sign up flows, we have provided HTTP endpoints that will return success/error responses depending on the request body.

### Mock users

Mock users have been created which the API will use to validate existence of users and password validity.

| ID   | Name     | Email              | Password  |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| 1234 | Jane Doe | jane.doe@gmail.com | $uPah4ckr |
| 1235 | John Doe | john.doe@gmail.com | P@s$w0rd  |

To test the sign in flow, you can try logging in with one of the above email and password combinations. To test the "existing users error" sign up flow, you can try signing up with one of the above emails.

## Billing history API

To build a billing history page that interacts with APIs, do one of the following:

- Build your own APIs that read billing history data from your own database using the provided billing history data.
- Use `billing-history.json` provided in the starter files.
- Fetch billing history data and apply coupons with our E-commerce HTTP APIs.

## Billing history API (sample data)

```
GET https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/account/billing/history
```

**Warning**: This API always returns the same data as it is not meant to be used in functional applications that should show the user's billing history.

This API is still useful if you only want to practice the front end aspects of fetching billing history data and displaying it.

### Parameters

No parameters.

### Returns

Sample data for a user's billing history.

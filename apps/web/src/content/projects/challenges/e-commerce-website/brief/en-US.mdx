In this challenge, you will integrate and assemble a fully functional e-commerce website for a fictional e-commerce brand, by linking individual pre-developed pages and sections.

As per previous e-commerce challenges, you will be provided with data belonging to the fictional e-commerce brand, including its product listings, collections and user reviews.

As this challenge is a combination of other sections or components, you should build them first to ensure all states and requirements are covered.

### Implementation requirements

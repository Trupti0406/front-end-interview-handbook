This challenge requires knowledge of basic responsive CSS and grid layouts. It's probably one of your first exposures to a challenge that is using responsive layout grids.

If you've done the [Hero Section challenge](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/hero-section-simple), you'll feel right at home as you put your CSS layouts skill to the test again. You may wish to experiment with a CSS layout system other than what you chose in the previous challenges!

## Relevant concepts

- [Flex layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Flex layouts are useful for adding gaps between a stack of elements. While flex is not the only way to achieve the layout, it is the modern way of doing so.
- [Grid layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/): Alternatively, you may choose to use CSS grids for this challenge. The grid layout is exactly what it sounds like: a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.
- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries): Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the characteristics of the device displaying the page, such as screen width, height, orientation, etc. They are crucial for making your component responsive across various devices. You can define breakpoints where the layout or styles change to accommodate different screen sizes.
- [Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML): How to render images where the original image doesn't necessarily fit within the allocated dimensions.

> Know that there are [many ways to lay elements out in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout). Flex and grid are two of the most powerful and commonly used layout systems in modern web development. However, there are other ways like [floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats), and [static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning).

> In this challenge, you can choose either flex or grid layout systems. If you're new to CSS, don't worry too much about the rabbit hole of layouts. You'll come across more challenges that'll help you understand these concepts better.

## Recommended approach

### Define the layout

Start by outlining the structure of the sections using HTML. Use [semantic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) like `<header>`, `<div>`, `<section>`, and appropriate content elements such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, and `<img>`. Ensure that the HTML structure is clean, logical, and accessible.

In this challenge, the layout is relatively simple. The headline and feature points/illustration are stacked vertically. The feature points and illustration are stacked horizontally on wide screens and vertically on narrow screens. Elements in the headline and feature points sections are stacked vertically.

Before beginning to build a page, always start by clearly defining the layout. Think of the HTML elements as rectangles, and decide how they should be arranged on the page. This is called an **outline**, and you'll get better at it as you get more familiar with layout systems in CSS.

### Implement responsive design

#### Layout

Notice that we didn't say "on mobile" or "on desktop" when we described the outermost layout; instead we said wide and narrow screens. When building responsive websites, don't assume anything about the _nature_ of the device on which your page will be loaded. If your layout is conditioned between container sizes, then condition the layout based on container sizes. Ideally, you should assume that your page will be loaded on screens of _any sizes_, so you should design your layout to look good on _any screen sizes_. Hence, **responsive design**.

These different "stops" of screen or container sizes is what we call **breakpoints**.

> Of course, there's a limit to how big or small a screen can _effectively_ be. For most websites, the minimum width is around 320px.

Use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to conditionally apply style properties. If you're using Tailwind CSS, use the [responsive modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

#### Typography

In the project brief, we see that in the narrowest screen, the overline, subtitle, and the feature points get larger. Similar to how you'd condition the layout, you can condition typography based on screen sizes based on screen sizes with media queries.

> In typography, [**overline**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overline) is a typographical feature of a horizontal line above a text. However, in graphic design, it's informally used to refer to a small text above a larger text that provides context or pretext to the larger proceeding headline, as seen in [Google's Material Design documentation](https://m2.material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#applying-the-type-scale). In this challenge, "High quality images" and "Best-in-class support" are overlines.

You can use media queries to conditionally apply _any_ CSS properties based on conditions like device type, screen resolution, orientation, and even user preferences, e.g., dark/light mode, reduced motion, data usage, etc.

### Implement the feature points

Use semantic elements like `<ul>` and `<li>` to represent the feature points. This helps web crawlers and screen readers understand your content, i.e., literal bullet points of features, better.

> If your browser brings in the (hideous) default list styles, you can remove them by using the [`list-style` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style). You can use CSS resets like [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to clear all default styles to make it easy to style your components across different browsers and operating systems. Major CSS libraries, like Tailwind CSS, already usually come with [preflights](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight).

Icons are obtained from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/). Refer to our "Icons Guide" for more details on rendering the icons. Note that the icons are contained within a circle that has a subtle shadow.

### Add the illustrations

Render the illustration images using its natural height for the permitted width, as specified by the design. This will allow the image to preserve its original aspect ratio.

There are different ways to fit an image in a container, e.g., cover, contain, stretch, tile, etc. If you've set an image as wallpaper on your desktop before, you might be familiar with these strategies as you try to make your wallpaper scaled and displayed nicely on your desktop. In CSS, these strategies are defined by the `object-fit` or `background-size` properties. [Learn more about these properties](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/object-fit-background-size-css/) and determine which one to use for the hero image in this challenge.

### Reuse the component for the other side

With the above approach, minimal changes are needed to implement the image on the other side. Simply swap the contents within each section. CSS layouts have a way to swap orders of elements stacking, so you should be able to swap the feature sections without changing any HTML—except for the class.

## Grid columns

> This section is useful if you decide to use the grid layout to complete this challenge.

Grids provide a structural framework for your design, ensuring that elements align properly across different parts of the layout. With a grid, you can streamline the design process, as it eliminates guesswork—every page-level section should take up N number of columns and the spacing between the columns have already been pre-determined.

By enabling [Layout grids](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-layout-grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows) in Figma (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>), you can see that on the "Desktop" breakpoint, the left section spans 5 columns whereas the right section spans 7 columns. A sample approach on how to divide the sections into 5 and 7 columns respectively is as follows. These are only for the "desktop" breakpoint. Changes have to made to also support "mobile" and "tablet".

```css
.container {
  max-width: 1440px;
  padding: 0 32px;
  width: 100%;

  display: grid;
  gap: 32px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
}

.left-section {
  grid-column: span 5 / span 5;
}

.right-section {
  grid-column: span 7 / span 7;
}
```

Read up on [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) if you aren't familiar with using CSS grid for layouts.

Typically, all pages for a specific website will be using the same grid layout. Most challenges on GreatFrontEnd Projects are designed using the same grid layout across all breakpoints.

### Responsive section behavior

To make the sections stack on top of each other on narrow screens, we can specify a different `grid-column` value for each breakpoint to take up the full number of columns, e.g., 4 for "mobile" and 6 for "tablet".

This is just an example, and changes have to be made to the container as well. Refer to the "Layout grid" guide.

```css
.left-section {
  background-color: red;
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .left-section {
    grid-column: span 6 / span 6;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .left-section {
    grid-column: span 5 / span 5;
  }
}

.right-section {
  background-color: green;
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .right-section {
    grid-column: span 6 / span 6;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .right-section {
    background-color: green;
    grid-column: span 7 / span 7;
  }
}
```

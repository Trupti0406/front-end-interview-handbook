This challenge requires knowledge of basic responsive CSS and grid layouts and is probably one of your first exposures to a challenge that is using responsive layout grids.

### Relevant concepts

- [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/): The features are laid out in a grid-like fashion with gaps between each cell, making CSS grid the perfect option.
- [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Flex layouts are useful for adding gaps between a stack of elements. While flex is not the only way to achieve the layout, it is the modern way of doing so.
- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries): Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the characteristics of the device displaying the page, such as screen width, height, orientation, etc. They are crucial for making your features section responsive across various devices. You can define breakpoints where the layout or styles change to accommodate different screen sizes.

### Recommended approach

1. **Build the header section**: Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<div>`, `<section>`, and appropriate content elements such as `<h2>`, `<p>`. Ensure responsiveness – the heading element has a different `font-size` and `line-height` on mobile. If you've built the other marketing section challenges that include a similar header, you're highly advised to reuse the styles.
2. **Implement a feature cell**: Icons are obtained from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). Refer to our "Icons Guide" for more details on rendering the icons. Note that the icons are contained within a circle that has a subtle shadow.
3. **Implement a responsive grid containing the features**: Turn on the layout grids in Figma and see that each feature spans 4 columns on desktop (33.33% of the container), 3 columns on tablet (50% of the container), and 4 columns on mobile (100% of the container). If you are using a templating system or a JavaScript framework, render each item using iteration helpers rather then repeating the feature markup.

### Grid columns

Grids provide a structural framework for your design, ensuring that elements align properly across different parts of the layout. With a grid, you can streamline the design process, as it eliminates guesswork – every page-level section should take up N number of columns and the spacing between the columns have already been pre-determined.

By turning on the "Layout grids" in Figma (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>), you can see that on the "Desktop" breakpoint, each feature item spans 4 columns.

Here's how the features grid can be implemented in HTML and CSS.

```css
/* These are only for desktop breakpoint.
  Changes have to made to also support mobile and tablet. */
.container {
  max-width: 1440px;
  padding: 0 32px;
  width: 100%;

  display: grid;
  column-gap: 32px;
  row-gap: 48px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
}

.feature-item {
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 1</div>
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 2</div>
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 3</div>
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 4</div>
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 5</div>
  <div class="feature-item">Feature 6</div>
</div>
```

### Responsive section behavior

To make the sections stack on top of each other on mobile and tablet, we can specify a different `grid-column` value for each non-desktop breakpoints to take up the desired number of columns – 4 on mobile and 3 on tablet.

```css
/* Changes have to be made to the container as well. Refer to the "Layout grid" guide. */

.feature-item {
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .feature-item {
    grid-column: span 3 / span 3;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .feature-item {
    grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
  }
}
```

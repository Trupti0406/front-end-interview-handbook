In this challenge, you will develop a minimal navigation bar that is typically found on e-commerce websites using the supplied designs that have been adapted for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

In addition to standard navigation options, there should also be an interactive cart icon, which displays the current item count and reflects the current number of items in a user's cart.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Links & Icon-buttons: **Implement and style interactable components like links and icon buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
  - **Buttons**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and disabled.
- **Dynamic shopping cart icon**: Display the current item count and update in real-time as users add or remove items from their cart.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Adaptive hamburger menu**: Hamburger menu should be implemented for tablet and mobile views. The menu should be shown once the hamburger icon button is tapped on.
  - **Transition on responsive breakpoints**: The transition from full navigation bar on desktop to hamburger menu on tablet and mobile should be fluid and natural, occurring at the appropriate breakpoints for tablet and mobile.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance across devices**: Ensure that the navigation bar and hamburger performs well on all devices, with quick load times and smooth transitions.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility**: Build the navigation bar and hamburger menu with a focus on accessibility, making sure that it complies with WCAG guidelines and provides a fully accessible user experience.

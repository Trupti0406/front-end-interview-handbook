This challenge is a composite of multiple other challenges. Therefore you should refer to those challenges for guides on how to build each section.

### Refactor your classes

Notice that certain components like buttons are used a few times on the page, with some variance:

- Primary inline button
- Secondary inline button
- Primary block button

The button classes should be refactored so that they can be shared and reused across the sections. Repeat the same process for other shared components on the page such as headings, subtitles, inputs, etc.

### CSS naming convention

For large code bases and websites, CSS organization can get messy very quickly. Adopting a consistent CSS naming convention is crucial to maintain code organization, readability, and maintainability. By following a CSS naming convention, you get the following benefits:

1. **Improved code clarity and understandability**: A well-defined naming convention makes it easier for developers to understand the purpose and scope of each CSS class or ID, facilitating collaboration and code maintenance.
2. **Reduced naming conflicts**: With a structured naming system, the likelihood of naming collisions or overriding styles unintentionally is minimized, preventing styling issues and bugs.
3. **Enhanced scalability**: As a project grows, a consistent naming convention helps manage the increasing complexity of CSS files, making it easier to locate and modify styles when needed.

A widely adopted CSS naming convention is the [BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/#naming-rules), which provides a systematic way to name CSS classes based on their role and relationship to other components. This convention helps create modular, reusable, and scalable CSS code. You're highly recommended to adopt a CSS naming convention.

### Spacing between sections

Take note of the spacing between each section; the spacing value is responsive and varies according to the device width.

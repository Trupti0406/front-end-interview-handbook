In this challenge, you will develop a responsive tab-structured product specifications section based on the supplied designs. This interactive component should allow users to navigate through different product features using tabs, seamlessly adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

While other challenges using this section may require dynamic content, the content for this particular challenge will be static and will be directly incorporated into the designs.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Tabs: **Implement tabs that allow users to click or tap to reveal content associated with each feature of the baby cashmere product
  - **Interactivity**: Implement active and inactive states
  - **Smooth transitions**: Ensure that the tab transitions are smooth, with content loading efficiently to keep engagement high and bounce rates low.
  - **Content loading**: Dynamic Content Loading: Dynamically load content within tabs to improve performance and user interaction.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
  - **Scroll shadows**: On smaller screens, where the horizontal width is insufficient to display all tabs at once, shadow indicators should appear on the sides of the tab bar to signal that additional tabs can be accessed by scrolling.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Code for fast load times with efficient CSS and JavaScript techniques.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility compliance**: Tabs should be fully keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly, with appropriate ARIA roles and properties.

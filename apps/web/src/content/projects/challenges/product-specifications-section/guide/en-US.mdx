In this challenge, you will develop a responsive tab-structured product specifications section based on the supplied designs.

## Relevant Concepts

- **Flexbox & Responsive Design**: Flexbox is essential for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. It provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange elements within a container, making it easier to create designs that work well on both small and large screens.

- **Tabs**: Tabs are a popular way to organize and present sections of content in a compact and easily navigable format. Implementing tabs allows users to switch between different sections without reloading the entire page. A full proper implementation of tabs involves handling active and inactive states, ensuring smooth transitions, and making sure they are accessible and keyboard-navigable.

## Recommended Approach

### Heading & Description

Start by creating the heading and description for the product specifications section using semantic HTML elements. This ensures that the content is structured logically and is accessible to screen readers.

### Tabs

Implement the tabs to allow users to switch between different product features. As tabs are an interactive element, JavaScript will be required for adding in the interactivity.

> Included in this sample code is the appropriate [ARIA roles and properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role) for tabs, to assist with keyboard navigation and screen readers. You can skip them for now if you're only starting out, but remember to check them out and spend some time learning more about them.

```html
<div class="tabs">
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="tab1">
    Feature 1
  </button>
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="tab1">
    Feature 2
  </button>
  <!-- More features... -->
</div>
<div class="tab-content" id="tab1" role="tabpanel">Content for Feature 1</div>
<div class="tab-content" id="tab2" role="tabpanel" hidden>
  Content for Feature 2
</div>
<!-- More content... -->
```

Style the selected tab header according to the design specifications. Use CSS to manage the appearance of active and inactive tabs.

```css
.tabs button[aria-selected='true'] {
  /* styles for selected */
}
.tabs button[aria-selected='false'] {
  /* styles for unselected */
}
```

Hidden tabs can use `display: none` to automatically unload and save on performance, ensuring that images and other resources are not unnecessarily loaded.

```css
.tab-content[hidden] {
  display: none;
}
```

For the JavaScript, you can either use a imperative approach through libraries like jQuery, or a more declarative approach with modern UI frameworks such as React.

#### Imperative approach

This requires you to manually check and update each and every element's property on every tab switch. You can see from the sample code below the code can be quite unwieldy at times, and harder to keep track of.

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
  $('.tabs button').click(function () {
    // Get the ID of the tab content to show
    const tabId = $(this).attr('aria-controls');

    // Unselect all tabs
    $('.tabs button').attr('aria-selected', 'false');

    // Select the clicked tab
    $(this).attr('aria-selected', 'true');

    // Hide all tab content
    $('.tab-content').attr('hidden', true);

    // Show the selected tab content
    $('#' + tabId).removeAttr('hidden');
  });
});
```

#### Declarative approach

In contrast to manually adding/removing attributes, a declarative solution with UI frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) can create a more straightforward approach, and keep the code easier to maintain. An example written in Svelte is shown here:

```html
<script>
  let selectedTab = 0;
</script>

<div>
  <div class="tabs">
    <button on:click="{()" ="">
      selectedTab = 0} class:active={selectedTab === 0} > Feature 1
    </button>
    <button on:click="{()" ="">
      selectedTab = 1} class:active={selectedTab === 1} > Feature 2
    </button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class:hidden="{selectedTab" !="" ="0}">Content for Feature 1</div>
    <div class:hidden="{selectedTab" !="" ="1}">Content for Feature 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

A UI framework can help keep code more intuitive and declarative in these cases. If you haven't, it may be a good time to look into using them to enhance your website going forward in your developer journey.

### Specifications

As these specifications are fully static, it may be a good idea to separate the content from the page structure. One way to do this is to define all the specifications in a JSON file or JavaScript object, then create one reusable template/component and populate the fields with the respective data. Here's a brief example code written in JavaScript:

```js
const specifications = [
  {
    feature: 'Feature 1',
    description: 'Description for feature 1',
    image: 'path/to/image1.jpg',
  },
  {
    feature: 'Feature 2',
    description: 'Description for feature 2',
    image: 'path/to/image2.jpg',
  },
];

function renderTabContent(specs) {
  return specs
    .map(
      (spec) => `
    <div class="tab-content">
      <img src="${spec.image}" alt="${spec.feature}" />
      <h3>${spec.feature}</h3>
      <p>${spec.description}</p>
    </div>
  `,
    )
    .join('');
  // outputs a string of HTML for each specification
}
```

For our data, you may want more nesting to help structure the data. JSON or JavaScript objects are infinitely nest-able, so adjust the structure to suit your needs.

```js
const specifications = [
  {
    feature: 'Feature 1',
    description: 'Description for feature 1',
    image: 'path/to/image1.jpg',
    points: [
      {
        icon: 'path/to/icon1.png',
        label: 'Key point 1',
      },
      {
        icon: 'path/to/icon2.png',
        label: 'Key point 2',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    feature: 'Feature 2',
    description: 'Description for feature 2',
    image: 'path/to/image2.jpg',
    points: [
      {
        icon: 'path/to/icon3.png',
        label: 'Key point 3',
      },
      {
        icon: 'path/to/icon4.png',
        label: 'Key point 4',
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

Use nested flex or grid layouts to position all components. Ensure that the layout follows the design specifications. For images, you may want to use [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to ensure the image fills in the specified size without stretching out the image.

```css
.tab-content img {
  /* sizes image to fill container without stretching */
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

### Responsiveness

To make the tab bar indicate more tabs, add shadows on the sides of the tab bar on smaller screens. This can be done with either [`box-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), [`linear-gradient()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient), [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), or a combination of them.

Use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to handle layout rearrangements at larger screen sizes.

## Further Considerations

### Accessibility

Including the appropriate [ARIA roles and properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role) for tabs can help assist with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

```html
<div class="tabs">
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="tab1" id="tab1-label">
    Feature 1
  </button>
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="tab2" id="tab2-label">
    Feature 2
  </button>
  <!-- More features... -->
</div>
<div class="tab-content" id="tab1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab1-label">
  Content for Feature 1
</div>
<div
  class="tab-content"
  id="tab2"
  role="tabpanel"
  aria-labelledby="tab2-label"
  hidden>
  Content for Feature 2
</div>
<!-- More content... -->
```

### Image Preloading for Hidden Tabs

Consider preloading images for hidden tabs to ensure that content loads instantly when a user switches tabs. This can be achieved by adding the `preload` attribute to the images in hidden tabs.

```html
<link rel="preload" href="path/to/image2.jpg" as="image" />
<link rel="preload" href="path/to/image3.jpg" as="image" />
```

This helps keep the experience responsive and updated, while reducing the amount of content needed for the initial page load.

This is the last challenge of the [Marketing track](/projects/tracks/marketing), it is highly recommended to have completed all the challenges in the track before working on this challenge!

To put together a website consisting of multiple pages, consider the following:

### Templating engines

If you are using vanilla HTML and CSS without any build process or frameworks, consider using templating engines.

All pages include the navigation bar and the footer. While you can certainly copy and paste the necessary markup and styles on each of the pages, it would be better to use a templating engine that enables reusing HTML across pages. Popular templating engines include [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/) and [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).

### URLs structure

Each page should be accessible via a different URL. To achieve this in vanilla HTML, create a folder for your website project, and within it, create separate HTML files for each page (e.g., `index.html` for the homepage, `features.html`, `pricing.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `404.html`, etc.).

The downside of this approach is that the URL will end with `.html`. Most hosting services supports URL rewrites and accessing a path will attempt serving a `index.html` at that directory so you can have directory structures like:

```
├── about
│   └── index.html
├── contact
│   └── index.html
├── features
│   └── index.html
├── pricing
│   └── index.html
├── 404.html
└── index.html
```

With this, your pages can be accessed with clean URLs that do not `index.html`. For example, accessing `https://yoursite.com/about` will serve `https://yoursite.com/about/index.html`.

1. **Link pages together**: In each HTML file, include navigation links (using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute) that point to the other pages. For example: `<a href="about.html">About us</a>`.

### Search engine optimization

Let's have a look at two ways to improve the SEO of the page – defining crucial metadata used by search engines and including a sitemap.

#### Title and descriptions

The title of the page is visible in the browser tab while the description is not visible to the user. Search engines use these data to understand what the page is about, hence each page should define the title and description fields.

To implement the page title, use the `<title>` tag:

```html
<head>
  <title>Page title goes here</title>
  ...
</head>
```

To implement the page description, use a `<meta>` tag:

```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Page description goes here." />
  ...
</head>
```

#### Sitemap

A website sitemap is a file or page that provides a structured overview of all the pages and content on a website. For this challenge, we're looking for an XML sitemap that is designed specifically for search engines like Google. They list all the URLs on a website along with additional metadata like the last modification date, update frequency, and priority. This helps search engines understand the website's structure and content, leading to better crawling and indexing.

XML sitemaps follow a standardized format that search engines can easily parse. They are typically submitted to search engines through webmaster tools or sitemaps protocols and are available on the root directory of your website as `sitemap.xml`, e.g. `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`.

Here's an example sitemap demonstrating the structure of a `sitemap.xml` file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.example.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2023-04-15</lastmod>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.example.com/about</loc>
    <lastmod>2023-03-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.example.com/contact</loc>
    <lastmod>2022-12-15</lastmod>
    <changefreq>yearly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.5</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

For each URL, it provides additional metadata:

- `<loc>`: The full URL of the page.
- `<lastmod>`: The date the page was last modified.
- `<changefreq>`: How frequently the page is expected to change (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
- `<priority`: The priority of the URL relative to other pages (ranges from 0.0 to 1.0).

### Metaframeworks

In practice, developers commonly develop multi-page websites using metaframeworks. Metaframeworks are higher-level frameworks that combine or include other frameworks and libraries. They provide an overarching architecture and additional functionality on top of core frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.

Metaframeworks are useful for:

1. Simplifying common routines like routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, data fetching, and code organization. This boosts developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code.
2. Building full-stack applications by combining capabilities from different frameworks and libraries into a cohesive development experience.
3. Improving performance through features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized bundling/code splitting.

Popular examples of metaframeworks include [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React), [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) (Vue), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) (Svelte), [Remix](https://remix.run/) (React), and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (React).

Metaframeworks help you easily create a multi-page website and makes it easy to implement the SEO features, among other useful things. We highly recommend using a metaframework for this challenge.

### Lighthouse audit

Run a [Lighthouse audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools, which provides comprehensive performance metrics for your website like First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), Total Blocking Time (TBT), and Speed Index.

To run a Lighthouse audit, follow these steps:

1. Open the website or web page you want to audit in Google Chrome.
2. Open the Chrome DevTools using <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>. Alternatively, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or go to View > Developer > Developer Tools to open Chrome DevTools.
3. In the DevTools panel, click on the "Lighthouse" tab.
4. In the Lighthouse panel, you can configure the audit settings. Select the categories you want to audit, such as Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, or Progressive Web App.
5. Optionally, you can click on the "Options" button to customize the audit settings further, such as simulating a specific device or network condition.
6. Click the "Generate report" button to start the Lighthouse audit.
7. Lighthouse will run a series of audits on the page and provide a report with scores for each category, as well as specific opportunities and diagnostics to improve the page's performance, accessibility, and other aspects.

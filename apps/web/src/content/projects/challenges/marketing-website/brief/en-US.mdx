In this challenge, you will integrate and assemble a fully-functional marketing website typical for a SaaS product by linking individual pre-developed pages and sections.

As this challenge is a combination of other sections or components, you should build them first to ensure all states and requirements are covered.

### Implementation requirements

The requirements that each component has to fulfill remains the same - you should refer to them in their individual briefs and ensure that their functionality remains intact after integration:

- [Marketing Landing Page](/projects/challenges/marketing-landing-page)
- [Features Page](/projects/challenges/features-page)
- [About Us Page](/projects/challenges/about-us-page)
- [Pricing Page](/projects/challenges/pricing-page)
- [Contact Us Page](/projects/challenges/contact-us-page)
- [404 Page](/projects/challenges/404-page)
- [Cookie Consent](/projects/challenges/cookie-consent)

### Integration requirements

- **Links**: All links (navbar, content, footer) should navigate correctly to the other pages within the marketing website.
- **Pages**: Each page should be on its own route and visitors can navigate between the pages easily. Since this is a multi-page challenge, consider building the website as a Single Page Application or using frameworks like [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).
- **Not found page**: Accessing a non-existent page should lead to the 404 page.
- **Cookie banner**: Integrate the cookie consent banner such that it is shown the first time a user visits any page on the website.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Lighthouse audit**: Perform a [Lighthouse audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse) and achieve above 90 rating for all sections of the report.

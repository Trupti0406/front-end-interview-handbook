In this challenge, you will develop a responsive 404 section for a website based on the provided design that must adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

This challenge will require coding a simple layout that adapts elements based on the device's screen size to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Button states**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
  - **Element adaptability**: Ensure that button elements resize appropriately.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary, using proper `alt` tags for images and ensuring that buttons can be navigated to and selected using keyboard controls.

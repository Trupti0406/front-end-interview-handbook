This challenge requires knowledge of basic responsive CSS and grid layouts and is probably one of your first exposures to a challenge that is using responsive layout grids.

### Relevant concepts

- [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Flex layouts are useful for adding gaps between a stack of elements. While flex is not the only way to achieve the layout, it is the modern way of doing so.
- [Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries): Media queries allow you to apply different CSS styles based on the characteristics of the device displaying the page, such as screen width, height, orientation, etc. They are crucial for making your features section responsive across various devices. You can define breakpoints where the layout or styles change to accommodate different screen sizes.

### Recommended approach

1. **Render the background image**: Render the image background that fills almost the entire screen. The `background-image` CSS property is recommended here.
2. **Define the section container**: Define a `<section>` that has a vertical padding of `64px` and is vertically-centered on the page.
3. **Implement the text and buttons**: These should be straightforward elements to add especially if it's not your first challenge. Note that the heading is responsive and differ in size across device breakpoints.

## Shopping cart data

To display the shopping cart data, do one of the following:

- Build your own APIs that read cart data from your own database using the provided products data.
- Use `sample-cart.json` provided in the starter files. Feel free to seed the "Carts" table in your database with this data.
- Fetch sample cart data from our E-commerce shopping cart HTTP API.

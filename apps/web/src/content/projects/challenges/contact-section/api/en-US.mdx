## Submit contact message API

To test your contact section, we have provided a HTTP endpoint that will return success/error response depending on the request body:

- Endpoint: https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/contact
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Content Type: `json`

### Request

All of the following fields should be present in the request body in order for the request to be successful.

| Attribute | Type     | Required | Description                 |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `name`    | `string` | Yes      | Name of the sender          |
| `email`   | `string` | Yes      | Email address of the sender |
| `message` | `string` | Yes      | Message body                |

### Response

#### Success

Success responses will have a HTTP status code of 200 and contain the `message` field in the response body.

```json
{
  "message": "Submission successful! We will get back to you in 3-5 days via email."
}
```

#### Error

Error responses will have a HTTP status code of 400 or 500 and contain the `error` field in the response body.

```json
{
  "error": "Message cannot be empty."
}
```

### Example

To test APIs, you're recommended to install the [Thunder Client for VS Code extension](https://www.thunderclient.com/), a lightweight REST client for testing APIs right within VS Code.

In this challenge, you will build a versatile pagination component as part of a design system. These components will be essential for navigating pages across various projects and apps found within the platform.

### Component states, variants, and properties

- **Current page**: Current page
- **Number of pages**: The total number of pages
- **Icon-only**: Whether to show icon only for the prev/next buttons

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Page numbers**: The first and last page numbers should always be shown. The numbers around the current page should also be shown. Any non-consecutive page numbers will have a "..." in-between.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

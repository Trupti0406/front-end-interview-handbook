## Sign up for newsletter API

To test your newsletter section, we have provided a HTTP endpoint that will return success/error response depending on the request body:

- Endpoint: https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/projects/challenges/newsletter
- HTTP Method: `POST`
- Content Type: `json`

### Request

All of the following fields should be present in the request body in order for the request to be successful.

| Attribute | Type     | Required | Description                     |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `email`   | `string` | Yes      | Email address of the subscriber |

### Response

#### Success

Success responses will have a HTTP status code of 200 and contain the `message` field in the response body.

```json
{
  "message": "Subscription successful! Please check your email to confirm."
}
```

#### Error

Error responses will have a HTTP status code of 400 or 500 and contain the `error` field in the response body.

```json
{
  "error": "Email format is invalid."
}
```

### Example

To test APIs, you're recommended to install the [Thunder Client for VS Code extension](https://www.thunderclient.com/), a lightweight REST client for testing APIs right within VS Code.

In this challenge, you are tasked with developing a responsive interface that enables users to update their notifications settings by channel and content.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Notifications form

- **Multiple notification types**: Include toggles for various notification types such as:
  - Marketing & promotional events
  - System updates
  - Course alerts
  - Updates from friends
  - Friend requests
- **Multi-channel notification toggles**: Each notification type should have toggles for the following channels:
  - Push (App)
  - Email
  - SMS
- **Toggle functionality**: Each toggle should be clickable and reflect the current setting for that notification type and channel.

#### 2. Form submission

- **[Stretch goal] Populate database**: Design a database schema that is able to support saving the notifications preferences.
- **[Stretch goal] Create endpoints**: Build your own endpoints based on the provided or created database schema to fetch data and save preferences.
- **API integration**: Use the provided or created endpoints to fetch data and save preferences.
- **Submission**: On clicking "Save changes", the form should submit the data to the API endpoint (provided or self-created), handling responses and errors gracefully:
  - **Success feedback**: Provide success feedback with "Changes saved successfully".
  - **Error response**: Handle any API error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) by displaying an appropriate message such as "Unexpected error. Please try again later or contact support.".

#### 3. State persistence

- On loading the settings page, the toggles should reflect the current user settings fetched from the back end.

#### 4. Error states

- **Data fetch error**: Show an empty state message titled "Unexpected error" with the description "We're facing some issues at the moment. Please try again later or contact support.".

### General requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity:**
  - **Toast notification**: This component is used for displaying error messages when it is not specific to any input field.
  - **Link / Button states**: Implement and style links and buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, focus and disabled.
  - **Toggle states:** Implement and style toggles to reflect different states - normal, hover, focus and disabled.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Code for fast load times with efficient CSS and JavaScript techniques.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

**Note**: It is recommended to complete the [Testimonial Card](/projects/challenges/testimonial-card) challenge before attempting this challenge.

In this challenge, you will develop a responsive testimonials section for a website based on the provided design that must adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

You are required to build a layout where the number of columns used to display the testimonial cards is based on the device's screen size.

### Implementation Requirements

- **Design fidelity:** Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The layout should be flexible and responsive, displaying testimonials in a single column on mobile, two columns on tablet devices and three columns on desktops and larger. The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
  - **Element adaptability**: Ensure that text elements and images resize appropriately without distortion or loss of quality.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

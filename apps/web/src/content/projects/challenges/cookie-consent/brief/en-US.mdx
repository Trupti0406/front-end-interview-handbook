In this challenge, you will develop a responsive and compliant cookie consent management system that provides users with the ability to accept, decline or customize their cookie preferences.

### Implementation requirements

Apart from the cookie management interface, which includes a banner and "Manage cookies" modal dialog, you will also persist cookie consent preferences across sessions and pages and conditionally load scripts based on the preferences.

#### Cookie management interface

- **Design fidelity:** Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity**:
  - **Button states**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
  - **Links**: Implement and style links to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and ensure that buttons can be navigated to and selected using keyboard controls.

#### Cookie management system

- **Consent logic**:
  - If the user chooses "Allow cookies", persist consent for all cookie categories.
  - If the user chooses "Decline all", persist preferences for declined cookie categories, except the essential cookies.
  - If the user chooses "Manage cookies"
    - Accept all: Persist consent for all cookie categories.
    - Decline all: Persist non-consent for all cookie categories.
    - Save: Persist consent for specific cookie categories.
- **Preferences persistence**: Ensure the browser maintains the consent state across sessions and pages. You can persist the preferences in the browser's permanent storage such as cookies or `localStorage`.
- **Interaction flow**: The banner or modal dialog will be dismissed after clicking on any button that signals a decision has been made.
- **Conditional loading of scripts**: The provided essential, analytics, and marketing scripts found within the starter code should be loaded conditionally by respecting the user's cookie preferences.

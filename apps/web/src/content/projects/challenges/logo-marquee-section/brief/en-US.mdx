In this challenge, you will develop a responsive logo marquee section that repeatedly cycles through customer logos. The marquee should rotate logos automatically in a seamless loop at a steady rate.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Marquee**:
  - **Continuous scrolling**: Display logos in a continuous auto-scrolling format in a seamless loop.
  - **Timing**: Implement a smooth, consistent animation cycle for the logos, with a steady pace that allows enough time for each logo to be clearly perused.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Element adaptability**: Ensure that the logo images resize appropriately without distortion or loss of quality.
  - **Responsive layout**: Ensure the marquee adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, showing more logos on wider screen sizes.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times. Ensure that the marquee's motion is smooth and doesnâ€™t cause layout shifts or impact the website's loading times.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary, using proper `alt` tags for images and ensuring that the marquee's movement can be paused for users who need more time to view the logos.

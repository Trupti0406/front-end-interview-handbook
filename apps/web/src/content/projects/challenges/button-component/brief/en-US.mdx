In this challenge, you will build a versatile button component that is part of a design system. These buttons will be used across various challenges and apps found within the platform, providing consistency throughout the user interface.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **User interaction**: While not needed for this challenge, buttons should be easily extended to respond to user interaction, allowing for future integration with various functions and backend systems.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility**: Buttons should meet AA standards of WCAG 2.1, including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for screen readers
  - Icon buttons should have `aria-label` attributes since there's no visible label.
  - Buttons should be focusable via the <kbd>Tab</kbd> button.

### Component properties

- **Variants**: Collection of buttons should have distinct visual styles corresponding to different situational needs – primary, secondary, tertiary, destructive and links.
- **States**: Implement and style buttons to reflect different states – normal, hover, focus, and disabled.
- **Sizes**: For each button style and state, we have 4 sizes – Medium, Large, Extra large and 2 Extra large
- **Icons**: Left icon only, right icon only, icons on both sides, or icon-only

### Tips

- Identify how you can reuse and compose your CSS classes together to produce the various combinations of button variants, states, sizes, and icons.

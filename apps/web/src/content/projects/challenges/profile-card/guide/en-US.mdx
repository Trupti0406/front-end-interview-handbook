This challenge involves basic HTML and CSS, but it is a fun one to complete because you can personalize it and use it as your personal homepage!

### Relevant concepts

These CSS concepts will be useful for this challenge.

- [Box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model): Understanding padding, borders, and margins is necessary for achieving the desired layout.
- [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Flex layouts are useful for adding gaps between a stack of elements. While flex is not the only way to achieve the layout, it is the modern way of doing so.
- Icon buttons/links: How to render icon-only links where there are the text isn't visible yet keeping them accessible.

### Recommended approach

1. **Build the page layout**: Render a background color for the page. Within the page, add a horizontally-centered card that is a fixed distance of `200px` from the top of the page.
1. **Build the card and its contents**: Display the avatar image, name, title, bio, button, and social links.

### Card layout

Observe that the card has a fixed width of `340px` and is a fixed distance of `200px` from the top of the screen (it is not vertically centered!).

- Set a fixed `width` and `margin-top` for the card.
- The card should not have a hardcoded `height` value; its height should be according to the vertical space taken up by its contents. This is the behavior by default in CSS, so there are no extra steps needed.
- To horizontally center the card on the page, a simple way would be `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto` or to make the card parent `display: flex; justify-content: center`.

The contents within the card can be separated into two sections:

#### Top section

Profile details section, with a fixed `gap` between each row, which can be achieved with `display: flex; flex-direction: column; row-gap: 24px`.

Note that the lines of text can differ in terms of font size and line height and also the color! Inspect the properties carefully and refer to the style guide.

#### Bottom section

This section also has the same `gap` value as the top section.

- **Button**: This button is full-width and should span across the entire card.
- **Social links**: Center-aligned icons with a consistent `gap` between each link button. Icons can be obtained from [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com/). Refer to our "Icons Guide" for more guidance on using icons.

Pay attention to the focus styles on the buttons and the icon links.

### Accessibility

Since the icon button/links do not have visible text, `aria-label`s should be added to the button links in order for screen readers to announce the intentions of the links.

Example HTML for building accessible icon button links:

```html
<!-- Add custom styling -->
<a
  aria-label="Link to GreatFrontEnd's GitHub profile"
  href="https://github.com/greatfrontend">
  <svg aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
</a>
```

### Customizing

Lastly, customize the avatar image, name, description, social media icons, and link destinations! Congratulations, you now have a new personal homepage that is uniquely yours.

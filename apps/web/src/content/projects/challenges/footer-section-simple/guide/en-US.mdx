This challenge requires knowledge of basic responsive CSS and flex layouts.

### Relevant concepts

- [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Flex layouts are useful for adding gaps between a stack of elements. While flex is not the only way to achieve the layout, it is the modern way of doing so.
- Icon buttons/links: How to render icon-only links where there are the text isn't visible yet keeping them accessible.

### Recommended approach

1. **Define the footer container**: Define a `<footer>` that has a vertical padding of `96px`, center-aligned content, and is vertically-centered on the page.
2. **Build the row of links**: Nothing too special here. Note that the gap between each link item is smaller on mobile.
3. **Build the row of social media links**:
   1. Icons are obtained from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). Refer to our "Icons Guide" for more details on rendering the icons.
   2. Since the icon button/links do not have visible text, `aria-label`s should be added to the button links in order for screen readers to announce the intentions of the links.
4. **Add the copyright label**: While you can hardcode the year, it'd better to dynamically render it based on the current date by doing `new Date().getFullYear()`.

### Accessibility

Since the icon button/links do not have visible text, `aria-label`s should be added to the button links in order for screen readers to announce the intentions of the links.

Example HTML for building accessible icon button links:

```html
<!-- Add custom styling -->
<a
  aria-label="Link to GreatFrontEnd's GitHub profile"
  href="https://github.com/greatfrontend">
  <svg aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
</a>
```

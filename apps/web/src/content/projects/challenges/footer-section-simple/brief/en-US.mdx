In this challenge, you will build a very basic website footer that is consistent with the provided design across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The footer should include navigation links, social media icons, and copyright information.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity:** Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Copyright notice**: Include dynamic year update in the copyright notice.
- **Link interactivity**: Implement and style links to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary, using proper `alt` tags for images and ensuring that buttons can be navigated to and selected using keyboard controls.

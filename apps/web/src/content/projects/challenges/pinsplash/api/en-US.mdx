## Unsplash API

This challenge relies on [Unsplash's Developers API](https://unsplash.com/documentation).

### Set up an application

1. Firstly sign up with [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) as a user.
2. Create a [developer application](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).
3. Upon successful creation, obtain the "Access key".

Note that demo apps are limited to 50 requests an hour, which should be sufficient for development.

### Unsplash JavaScript SDK

Consider using [Unsplash's official JavaScript wrapper](https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js) to save yourself the hassle of constructing HTTP requests.

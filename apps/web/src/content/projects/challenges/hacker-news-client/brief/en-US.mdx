In this challenge, you will build a modern client for Hacker News, a news aggregation and discussion platform that caters to tech enthusiasts. By using the Hacker News API, you will display real-time posts from Hacker News, but users will not be able to upvote, post discussions or submit new articles.

**Note**: The submission vs design comparison feature ("Solution vs Design") will not be accurate for this challenge as working with the Hacker News API involves real-time dynamic data.

### Functional requirements

#### 1. Feed interface

Implement the interface according to the provided designs for desktop, mobile and tablet

- **Views**: There should be 4 views, accessible through the sidebar chips. Data of each tab will be populated with a **specific endpoint** from the Hacker News API.
  - New
  - Ask
  - Show
  - Jobs
- **Listing card types**:
  - An external URL (The item card itself will have a **URL at the end**)
  - In-app article
  - In-app poll
- **Data to display on cards for New, Ask & Show**
  - Title
  - URL: If the post leads to an external URL, the domain will be displayed
  - Points
  - Author's username
  - Time: Display in relative format e.g. '5 hours ago', '2 days ago'
  - Comments: Display number of comments. If there are none, don't display anything.
- **Data to display on cards for Jobs**
  - Title
  - Time: Display in relative format e.g. '5 hours ago', '2 days ago'
- **Pagination**: Display 20 items per page, with a simple 'More' button to load the next 20 items
- **Dynamic display without reloading**: Switch between different views like new, ask, show, and jobs without reloading the page.

#### 2. In-app article or poll

If an item leads to an in-app article or poll, we display the content of the article or poll, as well as its comments

- **Meta data**: Display the title, points, author's username, relative time and number of comments
- **Main article or poll content**: If it is an article, display the text content. If it's a poll, display it in a poll format, with the options and number of votes per option
- **Comments**: Display the comment author's username, relative time, and comment content. Total comment count should include replies as well.
- **Comment nesting**: Handle comment nesting (i.e. when users reply to other users)

#### 3. API Integration

Integrate with the Hacker News API to retrieve real-time data for different categories (new, ask, show, and jobs).

- **Handling of API requests and responses**:
  - Loading state: Display when data is taking time to load
  - Empty state: Display in the case of any API errors or empty lists
- **[Stretch goal] Efficiency and Caching**:
  - Cache API responses where appropriate to reduce loading times and provide a smoother user experience.
  - Invalidate cache based on staleness or when new data is fetched to ensure content is up-to-date.

### General Requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Interactivity:**
  - **Toast notification**: This component is used for displaying error and success messages when it is not specific to any input field
  - **Link / Button / Tab chips states**: Implement and style links and buttons to reflect different states - normal, hover, focus and disabled.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Adaptive hamburger menu**: Hamburger menu should be implemented for tablet and mobile views. The menu should be shown once the hamburger icon button is tapped on.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Code for fast load times with efficient CSS and JavaScript techniques.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

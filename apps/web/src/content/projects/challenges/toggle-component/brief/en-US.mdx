In this challenge, you will build a versatile toggle component as part of a design system. These components will be essential for forms, data entry interfaces, and other interactive elements across various projects and apps found within the platform.

### Component states, variants, and properties

- **Sizes**: Small and medium.
- **States**: Implement and style the component to reflect different states â€“ initial/default, hover, focus, and disabled.

### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Toggling**: Clicking on the toggle element should toggle between the active and inactive states.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

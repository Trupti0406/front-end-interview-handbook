This challenge requires knowledge of basic responsive CSS and grid layouts and is probably one of your first exposures to a challenge that is using responsive layout grids.

### Grid columns

Grids provide a structural framework for your design, ensuring that elements align properly across different parts of the layout. This alignment creates a sense of order and cohesion.With a grid, you can streamline the design process, as it eliminates guesswork – every page-level section should take up N number of columns and the spacing between the columns have already been pre-determined.

By turning on the "Layout grids" (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>) in Figma, you can see that on the "Desktop" breakpoint, the left section spans 5 columns whereas the right column spans 7 columns. A sample approach on how to divide the sections into 5 and 7 columns respectively is:

```css
/* These are only for desktop breakpoint.
  Changes have to made to also support mobile and tablet. */
.container {
  max-width: 1440px;
  padding: 0 32px;
  width: 100%;

  display: grid;
  gap: 32px;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0, 1fr));
}

.left-section {
  grid-column: span 5 / span 5;
}

.right-section {
  grid-column: span 7 / span 7;
}
```

Typically, all pages for a specific website will be using the same grid layout. Most challenges on GreatFrontEnd Projects are designed using the same grid layout across all breakpoints.

### Responsive section behavior

To make the sections stack on top of each other on mobile and tablet, we can specify a different `grid-column` value for each non-desktop breakpoints to take up the full number of columns – 4 on mobile and 6 on tablet.

```css
.left-section {
  background-color: red;
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .left-section {
    grid-column: span 6 / span 6;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .left-section {
    grid-column: span 5 / span 5;
  }
}

.right-section {
  background-color: green;
  grid-column: span 4 / span 4;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .right-section {
    grid-column: span 6 / span 6;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .right-section {
    background-color: green;
    grid-column: span 7 / span 7;
  }
}
```

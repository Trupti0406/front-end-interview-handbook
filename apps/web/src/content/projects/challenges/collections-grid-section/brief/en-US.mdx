In this challenge, you will develop a responsive featured collections section based on the supplied designs, which have been adapted for desktop, tablet and mobile views.

This section is a grid that displays the 3 collections on the e-commerce platform. It should be built to be dynamic, displaying up to 3 collections fetched from an API, each with a collection name, description and featured image as the background.

You will be provided with data pertaining to 3 featured collections to display in this section. To complete the functionality of this page, you should build the [Product Listing Section](/projects/challenges/product-listing-section), and filter by the relevant collection if the user clicks on the collection's card.

### Implementation requirements

#### Collection cards

- **2 sizes**: Implement collection cards in "Big" size and "Landscape" size.
- **States**: Implement and style collection cards to reflect different states - normal, hover, and focus.
- **Modularity and configurability**: The component should be built to be reusable and modular, displaying up to 3 collections, each with a collection name, featured image and short collection description. The section's title should also be configurable.

#### General requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.
  - **Responsive layout**: The content should stack vertically on smaller screens and align horizontally as the screen width increases.
- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Code for fast load times with efficient CSS and JavaScript techniques.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

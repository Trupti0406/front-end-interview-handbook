### Objective

The Toolbar Component is a fundamental building block of our design system, providing a consistent and modular way to organize and present actions or features. The objective is to design a flexible and visually cohesive toolbar that seamlessly integrates into our design system, offering versatility across different sections of the application.

### Key Features

1. **Modular Action Items:**

   - Design a modular structure to accommodate various action items (e.g., buttons, icons) within the toolbar.

2. **Customizable Layout:**

   - Allow for customization of the toolbar layout, supporting both horizontal and vertical orientations based on design requirements.

3. **Responsive Design:**

   - Ensure the toolbar is responsive, adapting gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

4. **Iconography Support:**

   - Integrate support for icons to visually enhance and represent different actions or features within the toolbar.

5. **Text Labels and Tooltips:**

   - Provide options for including text labels and tooltips to enhance clarity and accessibility for toolbar items.

6. **Contextual Variations:**

   - Allow for contextual variations, enabling the toolbar's appearance to adapt based on the section or functionality it is associated with.

7. **Accessibility Features:**
   - Implement accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes, ensuring the toolbar is navigable and usable for all users.

### Technological Considerations

- **CSS/SCSS Styles:**

  - Provide well-organized and easily maintainable CSS or SCSS styles for seamless integration into our codebase.

- **JavaScript Interaction:**

  - Implement JavaScript functionality for toolbar items, including hover effects, click interactions, and dynamic updates.

- **Cross-browser Compatibility:**
  - Test and ensure the toolbar functions correctly across various web browsers.

### Success Criteria

- Consistent integration of the toolbar component across various sections of the application.
- Positive user feedback on the clarity and ease of use of the toolbar.
- Successful implementation within our design system, aligning with established visual guidelines.

In this challenge, you will build a versatile tooltip component as part of a design system. These components will be essential for adding context to elements across various projects and apps found within the platform.

#### Component states, variants, and properties

Tooltips are meant to be displayed relative to a triggering element. They can be customized according to:

- **Position**: Where the tooltip should appear relative to the triggering element. They can be at the top, left, right, or bottom.
- **Alignment**: How the tooltip should align relative to the triggering element â€“ start, center, end. This is only applicable to top and bottom positions.

#### Implementation requirements

- **Design fidelity:** Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Tooltip display**: When hovering over the triggering element, the tooltip will appear. For screenshot comparison purposes, only the tooltip needs to be rendered.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.**[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.

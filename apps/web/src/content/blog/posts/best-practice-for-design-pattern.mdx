Now that you’ve seen the most common design patterns across JavaScript, here are some tips that you should keep in mind when implementing them.

## Take Special Care To Understand if a Pattern Fits the Solution

This tip is to be applied before you implement a design pattern into your source code. While it may look like a design pattern is the end of all of your worries, take a moment to critically analyze if that is true.

There are many patterns that solve the same problem but take different approaches and have different consequences. So your criteria for selecting a design pattern shouldn’t just be whether it solves your problem or not — it should also be how well it solves your problem and whether there is any other pattern that can present a more efficient solution.

## Understand the Costs of Implementing a Pattern Before Starting

While design patterns seem to be the best solution for all [engineering problems](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/counter), you shouldn’t jump into implementing them in your source code right away.

While judging the consequences of implementing a solution, you also need to take into consideration your own situation. Do you have a large team of software developers that are well adept at understanding and maintaining design patterns? Or are you an early-stage founder with a minimal development team looking to release a quick MVP of your product? If you answer yes to the last question, design patterns might not be the most optimal way of development for you.

Design patterns do not lead to heavy code reuse unless they are planned in a very early stage of app design. Randomly using design patterns at various stages can lead to an unnecessarily complex app architecture that you’d have to spend weeks simplifying.

The effectiveness of a design pattern cannot be judged by any form of testing. It’s your [team’s experience and introspection](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/counter) that will let you know if they work. If you have the time and resources to allocate to these aspects, only then will design patterns truly solve your problems.

## Do Not Turn Every Solution Into a Pattern

Another rule of thumb to keep in mind is to refrain from trying to turn every little problem-solution pair into a design pattern and using it wherever you see room for it.

While it’s good to identify standard solutions and keep them in mind when you encounter similar problems, there’s a good chance the new problem you encountered will not fit the exact same description as an older problem. In such a case, you might end up implementing a suboptimal solution and wasting resources.

Design patterns are established today as leading examples of problem-solution pairs because they’ve been tested by hundreds and thousands of programmers over time and have been generalized as much as possible. If you try to replicate that effort by just looking at a bunch of problems and solutions and calling them similar, you might end up doing a lot more damage to your code than you’d ever expected.

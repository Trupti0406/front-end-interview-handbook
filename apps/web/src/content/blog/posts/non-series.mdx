In recent years, Instagram has seen a lot of changes — we’ve launched stories, filters, creation tools, notifications, and direct messaging as well as myriad other features and enhancements. However, as the product grew, one unfortunate side effect was that our web performance began to suffer. Over the last year, we made a conscious effort to improve this. Our ongoing efforts have thus far resulted in almost 50% cumulative improvement to our feed page load time. This series of blog posts will outline some of the work we’ve done that led to these improvements

While there are existing resources on how to make a good Software Engineering resume such as the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/) and [FAANG Tech Leads' Resume Handbook](https://www.faangtechleads.com/), they are general and not specific to Front End Engineers.

## Prepare an Awesome Resume

If you are facing difficulties getting interviews for jobs you apply to despite having the necessary qualifications, it could be because of your resume. Even highly qualified candidates may not know how to effectively present their accomplishments in their resume and therefore may not get shortlisted. It is important to remember that being underqualified is not always the reason for not being selected; sometimes it is simply a matter of poor presentation and not including the important content. Once you have made it through the resume screening process, your past achievements are secondary and your technical skills become paramount, which can be learned and improved upon. Hence getting your foot in the door by submitting a great resume that represents you well is extremely important.

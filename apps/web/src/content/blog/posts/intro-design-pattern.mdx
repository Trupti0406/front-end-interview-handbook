JavaScript design patterns are repeatable template solutions for frequently occurring problems in JavaScript app development.

The idea is simple: Programmers all around the world, since the dawn of development, have faced sets of recurring issues when developing apps. Over time, some developers chose to document tried and tested ways to tackle these issues so others could refer back to the solutions with ease.

As more and more developers chose to use these solutions and recognized their efficiency in solving their problems, they became accepted as a standard way of problem-solving and were given the name “design patterns.”

As the importance of design patterns became better understood, these were further developed and standardized. Most modern design patterns have a defined structure now, are organized under multiple categories, and are taught in computer science-related degrees as independent topics.

## Types of JavaScript Design Patterns

Here are some of the most popular classifications of JavaScript design patterns.

## Creational

Creational design patterns are those that help solve problems around creating and managing new object instances in JavaScript. It can be as simple as limiting a class to having just one object or as complex as defining an intricate method of handpicking and adding each feature in a JavaScript object.

Some examples of creational design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, and Builder, among others.

## Structural

Structural design patterns are those that help solve problems around managing the structure (or schema) of JavaScript objects. These problems could include creating a relationship between two unlike objects or abstracting some features of an object away forspecific users.

A few examples of structural design patterns include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, and Facade.

## Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns are those that help solve problems around how control (and responsibility) is passed between various objects. These problems could involve controlling access to a linked list or establishing a single entity that can control access to multiple types of objects.

Some examples of behavioral design patterns include Command, Iterator, Memento, and Observer.

## Concurrency

Concurrency design patterns are those that help solve problems around multi-threading and multitasking. These problems could entail maintaining an active object among multiple available objects or handling multiple events supplied to a system by demultiplexing incoming input and handling it piece by piece.

A few examples of concurrency design patterns include active object, nuclear react, and scheduler.

## Architectural

Architectural design patterns are those that help solve problems around software design in a broad sense. These generally are related to how to design your system and ensure high availability, mitigate risks, and avoid performance bottlenecks.

Two examples of architectural design patterns are MVC and MVVM.

## Elements of a Design Pattern

Almost all design patterns can be broken down into a set of four important components. They are:

Pattern name: This is used to identify a design pattern while communicating with other users. Examples include “singleton,” “prototype,” and more. Problem: This describes the aim of the design pattern. It’s a small description of the issue that the design pattern is trying to solve. It can even include an example scenario to better explain the issue. It can also contain a list of conditions to be met for a design pattern to fully solve the underlying issue. Solution: This is the solution to the problem at hand, made up of elements like classes, methods, interfaces, etc. It’s where the bulk of a design pattern lies — it entails relationships, responsibilities, and collaborators of various elements that are clearly defined. Results: This is an analysis of how well the pattern was able to solve the problem. Things like space and time usage are discussed, along with alternative approaches to solving the same problem.

When writing software, code documentation is practically required.

These documents are essentially a cheat sheet for your software, helping render the complex architecture of the code into more digestible concepts.

With code documentation, anyone can read your codebase and understand its structure, dependencies, and purpose.

The texts are a medium for knowledge sharing and help with code management.

However, the code documentation needs to be well-written for your developers to reap these benefits. Subpar documents aren’t of use to anyone.

That’s what this article is for: we’ll walk you through some tips on writing stellar code documentation that developers will love.

## Write Clean Code First

The purpose of code documentation is to explain code so that it’s easily understood and more manageable.

However, code is complex, and it’s challenging to write digestible documentation about it. The practice is often a specialized skill, and many hire technical writers for this specific task and for better technical documentation.

Now imagine if the code lacked consistency in the naming, syntax conventions, and functions. Such messy code would make writing documentation that much harder.

Therefore, to achieve high-quality code documentation, you first need high-quality code. Clean code is the prerequisite for code documentation.

A good starting point is the architecture of the codebase, as a logical folder structure allows developers to navigate the codebase easily.

Here’s a sample of React's folder organization: ![image](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/63e4baa1ce8bdf0aef69261a_T8EKfSyfN6oyUOeV5eMvEmwAqhBOWGNNJcwo0KUfdNaufCCu9vWDvs1bZaZ54iQONO_DwSpYhsL35lBUPRO8xz0UqwGG-DXJ5RRLpF2gBpaW7jFBsUlIPqfhQ7uGQHQ_2_5WzIP5mYVDEFNwvCNlYMc.jpeg)

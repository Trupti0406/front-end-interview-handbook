A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps software developers keep track of how their software development projects - desktop applications, websites, mobile apps, etc - change over time.

Each snapshot or state of the files and folders in a codebase at a given time can be called a "version." Version control systems were created to allow developers a convenient way to create, manage, and share those versions. It allows them to have control over managing the versions of their code as it evolves over time.

Version control systems also enable collaboration within a team of software developers, without losing or overwriting anyone's work. After a developer makes a set of code changes to one or more files, they tell the version control system to save a representation of those changes.

In this way, a history of code changes - or versions - is built up as the code evolves. This history is preserved so that all developers, even if they are working in totally different locations, have access to a consistent and up-to-date history of the project.

A version control system can also be referred to as a source control system, source code management, version control software, version control tools, or other combinations of these terms.

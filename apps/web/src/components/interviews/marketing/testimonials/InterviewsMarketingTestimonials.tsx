    testimonial:
      'GreatFrontEnd is the best investment you can make if you are going through a frontend interview process. There are a bunch of different prepping resources for backend roles in the market, but surprisingly, the selection for frontend material is not that great. The frontend coding exercises cover everything you could think of. The best part is that each of them has an editorial/solution section that explains step by step how to tackle the problem and multiple approaches solutions you could take; opposed to other products where you can only find solutions written by random people. Where GFE really shines is on the frontend system design section, even after being 10 years in big tech I’ve never came across such diverse and comprehensive material. I would even recommend GFE to people just trying to become better frontend engineers just for the system design section alone. ',

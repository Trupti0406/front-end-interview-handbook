title: Explain `Function.prototype.bind`
---

> The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

_Source: [Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)_

`bind()` is most useful for binding the value of `this` in methods of classes that you want to pass into other functions. This was frequently done in React class component methods which were not defined using arrow functions.

```js
const john = {
  age: 42,
  getAge: function () {
    return this.age;
  },
};

console.log(john.getAge()); // 42

const unboundGetAge = john.getAge;
console.log(unboundGetAge()); // undefined

const boundGetAge = john.getAge.bind(john);
console.log(boundGetAge()); // 42

const mary = { age: 21 };
const boundGetAgeMary = john.getAge.bind(mary);
console.log(boundGetAgeMary()); // 21
```

In the example above, when the `getAge` method is called without a calling object (as `unboundGetAge`), the value is `undefined` because the value of `this` within `getAge()` becomes the global object. `boundGetAge()` has its `this` bound to `john`, hence it is able to obtain the `age` of `john`.

We can even use `getAge` on another object which is not `john`! `boundGetAgeMary` returns the `age` of `mary`.

title: Can you give an example of an `@media` property other than `screen`?
---

There are four types of `@media` properties (including `screen`):

- `all`: for all media type devices
- `print`: for printers
- `speech`: for screen readers that "reads" the page out loud
- `screen`: for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.

Here is an example of `print` media type's usage:

```css
@media print {
  body {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

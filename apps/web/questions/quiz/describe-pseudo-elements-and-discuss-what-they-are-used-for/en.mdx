title: Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.
---

A CSS [pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). They can be used for decoration (`::first-line`, `::first-letter`) or adding elements to the markup (combined with `content: ...`) without having to modify the markup (`:before`, `:after`).

- `::first-line` and `::first-letter` can be used to decorate text.
- Used in the `.clearfix` hack as shown above to add a zero-space element with `clear: both`.
- Triangular arrows in tooltips use `::before` and `::after`. Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM.

## Notes

- Pseudo-elements are different from [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), which are used to style an element based on its _state_ (such as `:hover`, `:focus`, etc).
- Double colons should be used instead of single colon to distinguish pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements. Most browsers support both syntaxs since this distinction was not clear in legacy W3C specs.

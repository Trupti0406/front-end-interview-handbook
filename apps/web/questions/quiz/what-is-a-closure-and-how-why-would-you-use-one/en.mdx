title: What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
---

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

## Why would you use one?

- Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript).
- [Partial applications or currying](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8#.l4b6l1i3x).

title: What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
---

- Empty `div` method: `<div style="clear:both;"></div>`.
- Clearfix method: Refer to the `.clearfix` class above.
- `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` method: Parent will establish a new block formatting context and expand to contains its floated children.

In large projects, having a utility `.clearfix` class will be very helpful. `overflow: hidden` might clip children if the children is taller than the parent and is not very ideal.

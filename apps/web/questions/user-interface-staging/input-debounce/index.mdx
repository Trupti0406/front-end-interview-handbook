### Situation

You have some kind of text input box, where a user can type in a review for a business. Currently, the user has to click a "save draft" button if they wish to save a draft of their review to edit later.

### Goal

Desired functionality is to save* the contents of this input as soon as the user stops typing for 3 seconds. *You can assume there is a 'saveDraft()' function that will do the actual saving of the review draft.

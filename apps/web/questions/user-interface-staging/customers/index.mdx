Given a list of transactions as follows:

    const transactions = [
      {id: 't_01', customer: "Rose Roberts", amount: 84},
      {id: 't_02', customer: "Chris Cook", amount: 30},
      {id: 't_03', customer: "Mary Martin", amount: 42},
      {id: 't_04', customer: "Susan Smith", amount: 26},
      {id: 't_05', customer: "Rose Roberts", amount: -84},
      {id: 't_06', customer: "Rose Roberts", amount: 48},
      {id: 't_07', customer: "Susan Smith", amount: 122},
      {id: 't_08', customer: "Larry Lewis", amount: 30},
      {id: 't_09', customer: "Mary Martin", amount: 10},
      {id: 't_10', customer: "Chris Cook", amount: 60},
      {id: 't_11', customer: "Susan Smith", amount: -32},
      {id: 't_12', customer: "Larry Lewis", amount: 80},
      {id: 't_13', customer: "Rose Roberts", amount: 26},
      {id: 't_14', customer: "Ryan Roberts", amount: 44},
    ]

As you can see, each transaction is represented as an object with a `customer` field, `amount` field, and a unique `id` field. In this example, negative amount values represent refunds where money is being returned to the customer.

Part 1

Using the data provided above, display the transactions as an unordered list with the following format:

— <customer>: <amount>

Part 2

Using the data, write a function to find which `customer` has the highest total amount spent. Refunds are subtracted from the customer’s total.

Next, we can highlight the top customer’s name in the list. Give each occurrence of the top customer’s name a `yellow` background.

Note: Inline styles are acceptable for this exercise.

Part 3

Now we would like to make it easier for a user to find a specific transaction by adding the ability to filter the list to specific customers.

1. Add a text `input` above the list of transactions, and give it the label `Filter`.
2. When a customer name (e.g. “Rose Roberts”) is typed in the input, only transactions from that customer should be displayed. In addition, support the following features:
   1. Case Insensitivity: users should not need exact letter casing for the filter to work.
   2. Partial Matches: substrings of the customer name should match the full name.
   3. Empty Input: when the input is empty all list elements should be displayed.
3. Update the top customer to reflect the currently filtered transactions

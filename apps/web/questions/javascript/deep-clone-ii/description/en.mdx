title: Deep Clone II
excerpt: Implement a function that performs a deep copy of a value, but also handles circular references
---

**Note:** This is an advanced version of the [Deep Clone](/questions/javascript/deep-clone) question, you should complete that first before attempting this question.

The term "deep clone" is not formally defined in JavaScript's language spec, but is generally well understood in the community. It is usually defined as starting at the top-level entries of the value/object and traversing the object to make copies of all the properties in the object, thus leading to a completely new object that has no references pointing back to the properties in the original object. Any changes made to the deeply-copied object will not affect the original object.

Implement a `deepClone` function that performs deep clone as thorough as possible, taking note of the following:

- The input object can contain any data types.
- Cover the edge case where the input object is cyclic, i.e. the circular references should also be cloned.

## Examples

```js
const obj1 = {
  num: 0,
  str: '',
  boolean: true,
  unf: undefined,
  nul: null,
  obj: { name: 'foo', id: 1 },
  arr: [0, 1, 2],
  date: new Date(),
  reg: new RegExp('/bar/ig'),
  [Symbol('s')]: 'baz',
};

const clonedObj1 = deepClone(obj1);
clonedObj1.arr.push(3);
obj1.arr; // Should still be [0, 1, 2]

const obj2 = { a: {} };
obj2.a.b = obj2; // Circular reference

const clonedObj2 = deepClone(obj2); // Should not cause a stack overflow by recursing into an infinite loop.

clonedObj2.a.b = 'something new';

obj2.a.b === obj2; // This should still be true
```

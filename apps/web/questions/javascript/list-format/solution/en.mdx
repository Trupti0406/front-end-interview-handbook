import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import listFormat from '../src/list-format';

This question is inspired by the JavaScript API `Intl.ListFormat.prototype.format()` function.

## Solution

By looking at the examples, we can split the solution into two sections:

1. Processing the input list - removing empty values, sorting, de-duplicating.
1. Formatting the items into a second string.

The first section is pretty straightforward, we can just maintain an `items` array that we mutate according to the `options`.

The second section is a little trickier, but we can observe the following:

- The `length` option splits the array into two parts.
- The first part will be joined with a `, ` and the second will be joined with `and`. - Whether to show `X other(s)` for the second part is dependent on whether the `length` value is a valid value within the range `[0, items.length]`.

<MDXCodeBlock>{listFormat}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Notes

This function is not as usable as the `Intl.ListFormat.prototype.format()` API because the separators are hardcoded to be English. The `Intl` API is meant for internationalization (i18n) in the first place and also allows for customization of the separators (the comma and the `and`), so there shouldn't be any hardcoding of separators if this function is meant for production use!

To make this function better, we could allow customization of the list separator and the "others" separator.

Given two DOM nodes, we want to hide the lowest single DOM node such that these two DOM nodes will be hidden. Write an algorithm to find that DOM node.

## Edge cases

- What if the DOM nodes are the same?
- What if one DOM node is in the subtree of the other?

## Follow Ups

- Generalize the solution to K DOM nodes

## Note

This is a simplified version of Lowest Common Ancestor question and tailored to front end web.

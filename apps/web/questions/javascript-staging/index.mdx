- Infinite scrolling

## Front End Signals

### HTML/CSS

Can the candidate faithfully and elegantly reproduce a visual design?

- Layout (positioning, flexbox, box-model)
- Attention to detail (handle edge cases? anticipate bad input?)
- Browser compatibility
- Accessibility

Specific skills per question:

- Ad Units:
- Facepile:
- Profile Pic: `<img>` vs background, position: absolute/relative, nested links are invalid, a:hover b, display: inline-block
- Render Poll:
- Rich Text Ninja: Proper tree nesting, styling using tags vs classes (rare signal)

### DOM API

Does the candidate know how to interact with the DOM?

- basic traversal: `.parentNode`, `.firstChild`/`.nextSibling`/`.previousSibling`
- `.nodeType`

Specific skills per question:

- Find Node In Clone: Array methods on NodeList, basic traversal
- Text In Range: `.nodeType`, basic traversal

### Advanced functions, Async/Event-driven programming

Almost nothing in our codebase is linear or synchronous. Can the candidate think about problems in an asynchronous manner?

- Use of closures
- Using function as objects
- Preserving appropriate context and scope
- Rest/spread (or arguments)
- Async constructs (e.g. `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, callbacks, promises, etc.)

Specific skills per question:

- Clear All Timeouts: basic behavior `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, wrapping one function with another
- Debounce/Throttle: async reasoning, closures, clearTimeout on invalid value, rest/spread (rarer signal)
- Event Emitter: storing functions, this, rest/spread

### Front-end Perf

Does the candidate understand performance topics specific to the browser/web environment?

- Critical path
- packaging/loading/parsing JS
- `requestAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`
- scroll performance

Specific skills per question:

- Debounce / Throttle: knowing to do this to solve scroll perf (rarer signal)

### JS Language

Is the candidate fluent in JS best practices? Advanced function skills go with async above since candidates often have one and not the other.

- ES6 idioms (Map, arrow functions, etc.)
- Class construction
- Ability to use an object as a map successfully (looping over objects)
- Common methods and statements (`Array.filter`, `Array.splice`, `Object.keys`, `for-in`, `delete`)
- Awareness of JS idiosyncrasies (eg. equality tests, pitfalls, etc).

Specific skills per question:

- Apply Filters: `.filter()`, object as map, initializing nested maps, looping over keys, `Object.prototype` pitfalls (rarer signal)
- Clear All Timeouts: monkeypatching globals, object as map
- DOM Store: classes, understanding identity, array methods [solution A] OR object as map [solution B]
- Event Emitter: classes, array methods OR `for-in`/`Object.keys`

### Data Structures / Algorithms

Can the candidate pick a practical data structure and algorithm to solve real-world problems and successfully use it?

- Trees
- Arrays
- Stacks/Queues
- HashMaps (e.g. objects)

Specific skills per question:

- Apply Filters: understand (nested) hash maps
- Clear All Timeouts: understand array or object for storage of keys
- DOM Store: use an object or pair-of-arrays
- Event Emitter: store listeners in array or object
- Find Node in Clone: tree traversal, describing an element position by its path
- Rich Text Ninja: maintain stack of tags
- Text in Range: complex tree traversal

### Perf

Can the candidate analyze the performance of different data structures and pick an appropriate one based on perf characteristics?

- Familiarity with performance profiles of common data structures.
- Ability to analyze more complex units of code as a whole.

Specific skills per question:

- Apply Filters: reformat input data, avoid n^2 loop
- Clear All Timeouts: element deletion in array vs object, avoid n^2 loop
- DOM Store: contrasting perf of object vs pair-of-arrays
- Event Emitter: element deletion in array vs object
- Find Node in Clone: compare DFS versus path-based
- Rich Text Ninja: reformat input data
- Text in Range: tree traversal perf

### Bang out code

Can the candidate write a sizable quantity of bug-free code?

- Testing
- Debugging
- Dealing with complexity and edge cases

Specific skills per question:

- (Each question doesn't necessarily have something to list here, but noting a few interesting cases.)
- Event Emitter: mutation during iteration
- Rich Text Ninja: off by one errors, closing/reopening tags carefully
- RomToInt/IntToRom: dealing with many cases (?)
- Text in Range: off by one errors

Build a job board that displays the latest job postings from Hacker News with information like job title, author, and date posted.

## Requirements

- The page should show 6 jobs on initial load with a button to load more postings.
- Clicking on the "Load more" button will load the next page of 6 postings until there aren't any more postings.
- When a user clicks on a job title, they should be taken to the link in the job posting.

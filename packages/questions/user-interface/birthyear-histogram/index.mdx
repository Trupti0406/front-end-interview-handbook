Build a widget that fetches birthyear data from an [API](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1950&max=2019&col=1&base=10&format=plain) and plotting a histogram, bucketing by the data by decades.

## Requirements

- The API (https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1950&max=2019&col=1&base=10&format=plain) return 200 random data points from 1950 to 2019.
- Tabulate the data by bucketing the data by decades and plotting a histogram with the x-axis being the decade bucket and y-axis being the count.
- The y-axis should be appropriately labeled.

The example below shows a potential resulting histogram.

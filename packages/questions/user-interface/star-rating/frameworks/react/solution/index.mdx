## Solution

The solution is much shorter using React as compared to the Vanilla version.

We can create a `Star` component that takes in a `filled` prop which conditionally renders the appropriate classnames.

The component will need a state `hoveredIndex` which is used to track the index of the currently hovered star.

To determine whether a `Star` should be highlighted/filled, we check if any stars are currently hovered, if so, that takes priority and any star with `index <= hoveredIndex` should be highlighted. Otherwise, any star where `index < value` can be highlighted/filled.

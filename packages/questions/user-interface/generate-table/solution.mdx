## Solution

There are two parts to this question: (1) accepting user input and (2) generating the table.

### Accepting User Input

Since the table should only be created when the "Submit" button is pressed, an uncontrolled form works better here. Otherwise we will need two different state values (one for the form, one for the rendered table) for rows/columns (four in total!).

By using `<input type="number" min={1}>`, we ensure only numbers can be entered and leverage HTML validation so that the minimum value of the fields is 1. That way we don't have to write our own validation.

We can listen for the form [submit event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubmitEvent), obtain the `FormData` from it and retrieve the rows and columns value from the form.

### Generating the Table

Generating the table is pretty straightforward. Note that `<tr>` should be within a `<tbody>` and not directly within the `<table>`. The trickier part of table generation is the numbers within each table cell, which involves using a mathematical formula. The number sequence for each column depends on whether the column is an even or odd one, and they be defined using the following formula:

- Even: `rows * col + (row + 1)`
- Odd: `rows * (col + 1) - row`

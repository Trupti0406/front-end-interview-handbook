Implement a progress bar component which shows the completion progress by filling the bar proportionately to the progress (a number between 0-100, inclusive).

![Progress Bar Example](/img/questions/progress-bar/progress-bar-example.png)

## Requirements

- The filled bar can be of any background color. The example uses `#c5c5c5`.
- The completion % is shown in the center of the filled bar.

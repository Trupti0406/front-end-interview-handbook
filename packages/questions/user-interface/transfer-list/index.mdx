Build an app that allows transferring of items between two lists.

![Transfer List Example](/img/questions/transfer-list/transfer-list-example.png)

## Requirements

- There are two lists each initially containing 4 items.
- Each item has a checkbox that can be checked/unchecked.
- Transferring
  - Clicking on the double arrow buttons will transfer all items from one list to the other, as specified by the direction of the arrows.
  - Clicking on the single arrow buttons will transfer only the selected items, as specified by the direction of the arrows.
  - Transferred items are added to the bottom of the destination list.
  - Item selection (checked) states are preserved after transferring.
  - Buttons are disabled if there are no relevant items to be transferred.
- Adding new items
  - Items can be added to the bottom of each list by entering text in the input at the top of each list.
  - Assume that all items are unique and that items present in any list will not be added again.

title: Drop While
excerpt: Implement a function that excludes elements from the beginning of an array until the predicate returns false
---

Lodash provides a utility called `dropWhile` that creates a slice of an array with elements dropped from the beginning until the predicate function returns falsey.

Your task is to implement a JavaScript function `dropWhile` that behaves like Lodash's `dropWhile` utility using the following function signature:

```js
dropWhile(array, predicate);
```

The function takes two arguments:

- `array`: The array to iterate over.
- `predicate`: The predicate is invoked with three arguments: (value, index, array) and returns a `boolean` value.

Your function should drop elements from the beginning of the array until the predicate function returns `falsey`, and return the remaining elements as a new array. Your function should not modify the original array.

## Examples

```js
dropWhile([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (value) => value < 3); // => [3, 4, 5]
dropWhile([1, 2, 3], (value) => value < 6); // => []
```

Note that Lodash's `dropWhile` utility also allows you to pass an optional `thisArg` parameter to bind `this` inside the predicate function, but for this exercise, you can ignore that parameter.

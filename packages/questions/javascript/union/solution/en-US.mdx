import unionSetJs from '../setup/src/union-set.js';
import unionSetTS from '../setup/src/union-set.ts';

## Solution

This solution iterates through all the array elements, checks if there is any same value in `result` and push if there isn't.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: unionJs, tsx: unionTS }} />

Another solution will be using a set instead of array for `result` as sets automatically ensures uniqueness.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: unionSetJs, tsx: unionSetTS }} />

## Edge Cases

If the function is called with non-array arguments, it will throw an error because non-array types do not have the forEach method that the function relies on.

To solve this, we can check if each argument is an array using `Array.isArray` before attempting to iterate over it. If an argument is not an array, you can choose to skip it or add code to process these items separately.

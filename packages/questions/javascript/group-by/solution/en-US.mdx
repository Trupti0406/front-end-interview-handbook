## Solution

1. Create an empty `results` object to store the array of elements for each key.
1. Determine the `iteratee` function. If `iteratee` is already a function, we can use it as-is. Otherwise, if a string value was provided, a function is created to access that property on an element.
1. Iterate through the array and determine the key for each element by calling `iteratee(element)`. If the key does not exist within the `results` object, set the value for that key to an empty array. Next we can safely push the value into the array for that key.

An alternative way to create the `result` object is to use the [nullish coalescing assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_assignment) to set the value to `[]` if `key` doesn't exist within `result`. Note that using nullish coalescing assignment operator means you might be accessing inherited properties, which is not desired,but since the object is created via `Object.create(null)`, there will not be inherited properties and is safe to use.

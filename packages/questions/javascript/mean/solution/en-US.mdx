import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import meanJs from '../setup/src/mean.js';
import meanTS from '../setup/src/mean.ts';

## Solution

Here is a solution that sums all of the elements and divides it with the number of elements to get the mean using basic functions.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: meanJs, tsx: meanTS }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle overflow cases, we can split the array into smaller chunks and calculate the average of the average for each chunks.

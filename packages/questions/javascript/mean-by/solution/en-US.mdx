import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import meanByJs from '../setup/src/mean-by.js';
import meanByTs from '../setup/src/mean-by.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that finds the mean value of elements in `array` that passed through the function or is valid under `iteratee`, using `sum` for the total value and `found` for the existence of such elements.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: meanByJs, tsx: meanByTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle mixed data types, the `iteratee` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type or process them separately.

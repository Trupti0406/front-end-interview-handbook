import filter from '../src/array-filter';
import filterSpec from '../src/filterSpec';

This question is pretty straightforward and just tests that you know how to access the array values within `Array.prototype` methods (using `this`).

## Solution

Initialize a new array to store the filtered results. As we loop through the array (via `this`), call the callback on each array element with the following parameters: `element`, `index`, `array`, and `this`. This be done by either using `Function.prototype.call` or `Function.prototype.apply`.

If the callback evaluates to `true`, push the element into the `results`.

<MDXCodeBlock>{filter}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge Cases

- Passing the `index` and `array` to the filter callback.
- Invoking the filter callback with the correct `this` if `thisArg` is specified.
- Sparse arrays, e.g. `[1, 2, , 4]`. The empty values should be ignored while traversing the array.

## Notes

Mutating the array in the filter callback is a bad idea and can cause unintended consequences. The provided solution does not follow the TC39 specification for array mutation scenarios, neither does the autograder check for the specification behavior for mutations.

You probably won't be asked to implement the specification behavior during interviews but it is still a positive signal to mention that mutation of the array within the callback is possible but your code might not follow the specifications for it.

The `thisArg` doesn't do anything if the callback is defined as an arrow function as arrow functions don't have their own bindings to `this`.

## One-liner Solution

You can cheat the autograder by doing this:

```js
Array.prototype.myFilter = Array.prototype.filter;
```

## Spec Solution

Here's a solution that is based off the [`Array.prototype.filter` ECMAScript specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-array.prototype.filter).

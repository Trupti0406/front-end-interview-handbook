title: Compact
excerpt: Implement a function to filter out falsey values.

## Lodash's Compact method
In JavaScript, the Lodash library provides a utility function called compact, which removes falsey values (i.e., values that evaluate to false in a boolean context) from an array. The values false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN are falsey.

Let's write our own version as a `compact` function. The function has the following signature:

```js
compact(array);
```

## Examples

```js
compact([0, 1, false, 2, '', 3, null]); // => [1, 2, 3]
compact(['hello', 123, [], {}, function() {}]) // => ['hello', 123, [], {}, function() {}]
```

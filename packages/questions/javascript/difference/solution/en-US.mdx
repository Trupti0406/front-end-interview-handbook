import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import difference from '../setup/src/difference';

## Solution

<MDXCodeBlock>{difference}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge Cases

To handle sparse arrays such as `[1, ,3]`, the `in` operator is used check if the index `i` is present in the `array` before checking if the value at index `i` is undefined. This ensures that sparse arrays are handled correctly.

import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import differenceJs from '../setup/src/difference.js';
import differenceTs from '../setup/src/difference.ts';

## Solution

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: differenceJs, tsx: differenceTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle sparse arrays such as `[1, ,3]`, the `in` operator is used check if the index `i` is present in the `array` before checking if the value at index `i` is undefined. This ensures that sparse arrays are handled correctly.

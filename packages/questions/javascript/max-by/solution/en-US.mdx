import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import maxByJs from '../setup/src/max-by.js';
import maxByTs from '../setup/src/max-by.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that finds the maximum element in `array` based on a given `iteratee`, using `result` for the element and `computed` for its value comparison.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: maxByJs, tsx: maxByTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle mixed data types, the `iteratee` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type or process them separately.

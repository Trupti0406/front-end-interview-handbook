import uniqBySetJs from '../setup/src/uniqBySet.js';
import uniqBySetTs from '../setup/src/uniqBySet.ts';

## Solution

We can use a new array `compare` to store the unique value of the elements in `array` after being invoked by `iteratee` and store the corresponding values in `result`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: uniqByJs, tsx: uniqByTs }} />

Alternatively, we can use set to replace the `compare` array to check for unique elements. A Set can help in tracking uniqueness which ensures faster lookups (constant time complexity) for large datasets, making it more efficient than the previous code which uses an array (`compare.includes`) for tracking, resulting in slower (linear time complexity) lookups as the dataset grows.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: uniqBySetJs, tsx: uniqBySetTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle mixed data types, the `iteratee` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type or process them separately.

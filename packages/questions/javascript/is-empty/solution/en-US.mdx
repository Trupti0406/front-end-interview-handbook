import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import isEmpty from '../src/is-empty';

## Solution

The important part of this question is to be aware of how to check for each type of data and how to determine whether it's empty.

Note Lodash's `isEmpty` also checks for less common data types like `arguments` objects and DOM collections but we've excluded that from the solution.

<MDXCodeBlock>{isEmpty}</MDXCodeBlock>

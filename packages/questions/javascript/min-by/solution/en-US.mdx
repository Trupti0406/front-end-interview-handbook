import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import minByJs from '../setup/src/min-by.js';
import minByTs from '../setup/src/min-by.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that finds the minimum element in `array` based on a given `iteratee`, using `result` for the element and `computed` for its value comparison.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: minByJs, tsx: minByTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle mixed data types, the `iteratee` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type or process them separately.

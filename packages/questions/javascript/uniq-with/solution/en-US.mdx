import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import uniqueWithJs from '../setup/src/uniq-with.js';
import uniqueWithTs from '../setup/src/uniq-with.ts';

## Solution

We can use the array function `findIndex` to iterate through each element in the `result` array to check if there was the same value when compared by `comparator`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: uniqueWithJs, tsx: uniqueWithTs }} />

## Edge Cases

To handle mixed data types, the `comparator` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type.

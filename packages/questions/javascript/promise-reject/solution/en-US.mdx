import promiseReject from '../src/promise-reject';

## Solution

`Promise.reject` returns a `Promise` that is rejected. It is essentially a shorthand for `new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject(reason))`.

The only thing we need to note is to wrap the `reason` value in a new `Promise` object even when `reason` is already a `Promise`.

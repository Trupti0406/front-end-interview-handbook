title: Curry
excerpt: Implement a function that transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that can be repeatedly called with only one argument at a time
---

Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.

Implement the `curry` function which accepts a function as the only argument and returns a function that accepts single arguments and can be repeatedly called until at least the minimum number of arguments have been provided (determined by how many arguments the original function accepts). The initial function argument is then invoked with the provided arguments.

## Examples

```js
function addTwo(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const curriedAddTwo = curry(addTwo);
curriedAddTwo(3)(4); // 7

const alreadyAddedThree = curriedAddTwo(3);
alreadyAddedThree(4); // 7
```

```js
function multiplyThree(a, b, c) {
  return a * b * c;
}

const curriedMultiplyThree = curry(multiplyThree);
curriedMultiplyThree(4)(5)(6); // 120

const containsFour = curriedMultiplyThree(4);
const containsFourMulFive = containsFour(5);
containsFourMulFive(6); // 120
```

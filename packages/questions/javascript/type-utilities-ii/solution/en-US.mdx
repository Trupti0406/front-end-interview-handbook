## Solution

### `isArray`

Since ES5, there exists an `Array.isArray()` function which does exactly what we need here.

However, if we're not allowed to use this or need to support old browsers, we can check the constructor of the object. However, some values like `null` and `undefined` have to be specially handled.

### `isFunction`

We can simply use `typeof value === 'function'` to check.

### `isObject`

`null` and `undefined` are considered `Object`s, so we need to handle them specially as well. `Function`s are also objects.

### `isPlainObject`

There are two types of plain objects:

1. Objects without prototypes, created using `Object.create(null)`s.
1. Object defined using literals (e.g. `let a = {}`).

To check for the first case, `Object.getPrototypeOf(value)` will be exactly `null`. To check for the second case, we can use the constructor of its prototype, similar to how we check if an object is an `Array`.

Lodash's implementation of `isPlainObject` traverses the object's prototype chain but that's unnecessary if we check the constructor.
